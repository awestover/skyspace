<td><a href="probabilistic_method">Probabistic Method</a></td>
<td>Lots of neat combinatorics. Follows the book “The Probabilistic Method” by Noga Alon and Joel Spencer, which details an elegant perspective on combinatorics problems initiated by Erdos.</td>
<td>Need some basic combinatorics. I’ll try to define the new combinatorial objects I come across though.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><a href="functional_analysis">Funtional Analysis</a></td>
<td>Build up to, and proof of Projection Theorem. Might also talk about general Banach spaces but probably mostly Hilbert spaces.</td>
<td>Technically no prereqs, but it’ll be easier to follow if you’ve had an introductory college course in Linear Algebra and Real Analysis ;)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><a href="intro_to_linear_algebra">Introduction To Linear Algebra</a></td>
<td>An introduction to linear algebra. It will be a pretty different introduction than you are likely to get elsewise (AFAIK). I hope it will be a good one.</td>

<td>I read a cool paper <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00168">Bilò, Davide, et al. “Cutting Bamboo Down to Size.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00168 (2020)</a> and wrote a little “summary” of it.</td>

<td><a href="fastIntegerMultiplication">Fast Integer Multiplication</a></td>
<td>Do you feel like you’re not fast enough at math? What if there were a provably faster way to do almost every computation (up to constants)? Nearly every computation that you ever do relies on multiplication (sorry if this offends anyone). In this blog post I show how to multiply together two n-digit numbers not in time <span class="math inline">\(O(n^2)\)</span>, like you’ve been doing your whole life till now, but in time <span class="math inline">\(O(n \log n)\)</span> using the Fast Fourier Transform. Wow!! <em>terms and conditions may apply</em></td>
<td>You need to know what complex numbers are, some linear algebra is probably useful. It’s not a self contained introduction to digital signal processing, you an see <a href="digitalSignalProcessing/digitalSignalProcessing.pdf">Digital Signal Processing</a> for an introduction to digital signal processing. But technically you don’t need to know any DSP to understand the article, because I define a fourier transform.</td>

<tr class="even">
<td><a href="randomizedAlgorithms">Randomized Algorithms</a></td>
<td>An introduction to how to analyze a specific type of randomized algorithm. There is a lot of introductory probability in here.</td>
<td>Knowing a bit of probability would probably be helpful</td>
</tr>

<td><a href="cacheBehavior">Cache Behavior</a></td>
<td>An introduction to the performance benefits that cache behavior can bring to a program.</td>

<td>Read this if you are interested in any of the following questions: “what is a meausre space?”, “what’s a set in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>” that has no well defined inner-measure? / why do measure spaces need <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>-Algebra’s defined on them?“,”what’s a Lesbegue integral?“,”what’s Lesbegue’s dominated convergence theorem?"

<td><a href="vectorCalculus">Vector Calculus</a></td>
<td>Talk about div, grad, curl, then about why differential forms are better. introduce important vector calculus notions, and talk about wedge products, differential forms, exterior derivatives, stokses thm <span class="math inline">\(\int_B d\phi = \int_{\partial B} \phi\)</span>, (<em>note: work in progress</em>)</td>

<td>compressiony stuff</td>
<td>I guess a bit of familiarity with the tree data structure is nice, but really this is a very accesible article, I hope</td>
