<td>Build up to, and proof of Projection Theorem. Might also talk about general Banach spaces but probably mostly Hilbert spaces.</td>
<td>Technically no prereqs, but it’ll be easier to follow if you’ve had an introductory college course in Linear Algebra and Real Analysis ;)</td>

<td><a href="fastIntegerMultiplication">Fast Integer Multiplication</a></td>
<td>Do you feel like you’re not fast enough at math? What if there were a provably faster way to do almost every computation (up to constants)? Nearly every computation that you ever do relies on multiplication (sorry if this offends anyone). In this blog post I show how to multiply together two n-digit numbers not in time O(n^2), like you’ve been doing your whole life till now, but in time O(n log n) using the Fast Fourier Transform. Wow!! *terms and conditions may apply</td>
<td>You need to know what complex numbers are, some linear algebra is probably useful. It’s not a self contained introduction to digital signal processing, you an see <a href="digitalSignalProcessing/digitalSignalProcessing.pdf">Digital Signal Processing</a> for an introduction to digital signal processing. But technically you don’t need to know any DSP to understand the article, because I define a fourier transform.</td>
