trick:
"arithmetize" the boolean circuit.
This means extend it to be a function over the integers.

"while two boolean functions might only disagree in a single
place, if you arithmetize different boolean functions they are
gonna disagree in a lot of places. That's because Polynomials
aren't too bouncy."
