<p>ok so TSP on an arbitrary graph is actually just too hard: there might not even be a hamiltonian cycle in the graph, and checking this is already NP-complete. So as a simplification we are just going to consider some nice graphs.</p>
<p>In particualr, we consider graphs that define metric spaces: i.e. all edges are defined, and the edge-costs satisfy the triangle inequality. <span class="math display">\[w_{a\to b} + w_{b\to c} \geq w_{a\to c}.\]</span> This is a fairly reasonable set of graphs, and it has the nice property that by virtue of being complete there will always be a hamiltonian cycle. Nice.</p>
<p>OK but TSP is still NP-hard on these nicer graphs. What to do? Well let’s just approximate it.</p>
<p>Consider the following relaxation of TSP: Find a minimal-cost connected sub-graph spanning the graph. Now of course, the TSP tour is a connected sub-graph spanning the graph.<br />
But actually the minimal-cost connected sub-graph spanning the graph is just the Minimum spanning tree (MST).</p>
<p>of course the MST is not really path-y. But actually we can turn it into a path not too hard.</p>
<div class="prop envbox">
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> If you just do a DFS traversal of the MST you get a 2-approx for TSP.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> clearly <span class="math inline">\(2MST \leq 2TSP\)</span>, so its cost is <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>-competitive. On the other hand, it is a tour! yay.</p>
</div>
<p>So that was easy, and computing MSTs is easy. epic. On the other hand, we can actually do better!</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> we can do a 1.5 approx to TSP pretty dang fast</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> take the vertices in the MST with odd degree and form a min-cost matching on them. This turns the MST into an eulerian graph, so it defines a path. on the other hand, one possible matching is taking less than every other edge in the TSP tour. So we are 1.5 compettive.</p>
</div>
<p>finally, apparently some dudes got like 1.4999 or something.</p>
