# The Probabilistic Method 

### preface
I am going to try to read "The Probablistic Method" by Noga Alon and Joel H.
Spencer. The Probablistic Method, pioneered by Erdos, is a really interesting
way to think about combinatorics problems. Here is a high level overview of how
proofs by the probabilistic method go 

> Consider a random thing
> Break the thing up into simple sub-things
> Compute something on the sub-things
> Combine the sub-things together to get 
> Pr[thing is good] > 0
> Thus, there must be some thing that is good.

The approach is often pretty non-constructive but sometimes it can be made
constructive. 

I want to read this book because I believe that it contains some really elegant
math, and I think math is super cool. The first half of my senior year wasn't
super fun for me; I was super busy and doing a lot of things that I didn't find
very interesting. Thinking back on that time, the most prominent positive
memory is of math. In particular, I was taking a functional analysis class.
Twice a week, every week, I would rush out of school and jump on my bike to
ride over to the local university (Harvard) where I was listening to the
lectures. I left behind all the baggage of tasks performed grudgingly and was
immersed in theland of infinite dimensional vector spaces for a magnificent
hour. On weekends, and in other spare moments of time that I could find I
worked on the psets for the class, which usually consisted of a couple really
interesting and often challenging proofs.

There are a couple things that I think made my experience in this functional
analysis class so great

- I was taking it purely for fun (in particular, I didn't tell my school that I was taking it, and didn't do anythign with my grade)
- An incredibly enthusiastic professor guided me through the definitions and theorems of the book, with many fun examples 
- The content had some really interesting and non-trivial, while still elegant, proofs. 
- Doing math with other people. (I had a fun time sharing the cool stuff that I was learning about in class with other people, in fact I gave a talk about it to our math team and [wrote a blog post about it!!!](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/functional_analysis/) 

Anyways, this whole story did have a point.

I love math. But keeping a consistent schedule, even at doing things that you
love, is hard, especially if the thing you like to do is challenging. 
That's where this blog comes in. 
I'm going to write a (time stamped!) blog post **every week by Friday** about
the chapter of the Probabilistic Method that I've been reading.
Having a blog means that with non-zero probability some people will be sad if I
don't read a week. It also gives me a very nice record of the things I've
learned, and will look very cool (I hope to draw lots of pictures). 
Also, maybe this blog can teach you some cool combinatorics too! I will do my
best to make my explanations compelte and understandable to people who haven't
been reading the book. In particular I will introduce any combinatorial objects
that it talks about.

If you're interested in reading this, don't be put off by all the fancy words
and stuff. I didn't know what a "Ramsey number" or a "Hypergraph" was before
reading this book either. In actuality these are not too complicated ideas; I
hope to be able to convince you of this proposition by drawing some pictures.

- If you read this and think it's cool please let me know! 
- If you read this and are confused about something, also let me know! I'd love to talk about it!
- If you read this and think I've botched some math somewhere, definitely let me know!

This is difficult stuff, there are a lot of exercises from the sections that
I've read that I haven't been able to figure out **yet**.

A final note to the reader: this blog is probably gonna get very casual in
terms of language used. In particular I'm potentially gonna use slang, and
exclamations of excitement such as "yo epic" and "now that's pretty cool" or
similar. Also there are going to be a **lot** of speelling mistakes. I hope
neither of these things distract from the mahtematical content of the blog (in
fact I bet the "enthusiasm" will be helpful)

Now we begin our discussion of **THE PROBABILISTIC METHOD**!!!!!!
