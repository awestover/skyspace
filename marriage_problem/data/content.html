<p>Bob has a pool of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people that he is willing to date. Each of these <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> people has some <strong>“goodness-score”</strong> that Bob is able to discover after dating them for a week. Bob writes the people’s names down on a list in a random permutation, and plans to go down the list dating people, until he stops and chooses someone to marry. After dating someone for a week Bob must either decide whether to reject the person or marry them. This decision cannot be reversed once made. <strong>The Question:</strong> What is the optimal dating strategy for Bob, where by optimal we mean the strategy that maximizes Bob’s probability of ending up married to the person with the highest goodness-score?</p>
<p>This problem is both theoretically interesting as a neat combinatorial puzzle, and practically interesting; the applications of an optimal dating strategy are clear.</p>
<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> The optimal strategy must be of the form “date <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> people without considering them, and then marry the first person after the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th person who has a higher goodness-score then any of the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> people that you dated.”</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Obviously the optimal strategy never consists of choosing someone worse than the people that you’ve already seen; doing so is never productive towards achieving the best person.</p>
<p>Every time Bob finishes dating someone and they have a goodness-score higher than all previously seen goodness-scores, Bob has two choices: he can marry them, or not.</p>
<p>Bob may as well write down on his list a <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> or a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> next to people’s names based on which of these situations he will choose. That is, if next to name <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> Bob writes a <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, then Bob is not going to marry person <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> no matter what, and if next to name <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> Bob writes a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> then Bob is going to marry person <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> if and only if Bob has not married some person <span class="math inline">\(j &lt; i\)</span> and person <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> had goodness-score higher than all people <span class="math inline">\(j &lt; i\)</span>.</p>
<p>We claim that in the optimal strategy all the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>’s on Bob’s list are at the bottom of the list, and all the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>’s are at the top.</p>
<p>Consider a list where this is not the case. In particular, say that for people <span class="math inline">\(i, j\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(i &lt; j\)</span> there is a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> on person <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s name and a <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> on person <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>’s name. We claim that by swapping the <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and the <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> we get a better strategy (in terms of probability). We prove this by considering when it is better to swap.</p>
<ul>
<li>If the best person is some <span class="math inline">\(k &lt; i\)</span> then it doesn’t matter at all whether or not we swap</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the best person, then it is obviously better to not swap</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(k &gt; i\)</span> is the best person, then actually swapping is a really good idea. Having an extra baseline measurement is pretty helpful for declining future people.</li>
</ul>
<p>We leave computing the exact probabilities as an exercise for the interested reader.</p>
</div>
Now that we know essentially what Bob’s strategy should look like, we optimize the parameter <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>.
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> The optimal number of people to use as a baseline is approximately <span class="math inline">\(n/e\)</span> for large <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. By setting <span class="math inline">\(k \approx n/e\)</span> Bob gets an approximately <span class="math inline">\(1/e\)</span> chance of marrying the person with the highest goodness-score.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Say that Bob is using the strategy “marry the first person better than all of the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> people”. We now compute the probability that Bob marries the best person by using this strategy.</p>
<p>Of course there is a <span class="math inline">\(k/n\)</span> chance that the best person is one of the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> people Bob dates. In this case Bob just loses. :(</p>
<p>Now we condition on the best person not being one of the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> people that Bob dates; this happens with probability <span class="math inline">\((n-k)/n\)</span>.</p>
<p>In this case the probability that Bob wins can be computed by summing over values of who the best person is, and for each of these values determining what the probability is that Bob wasn’t tricked in to marrying someone earlier.</p>
<p>If person <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is the best, then Bob wins if and only if the second best person, from among the first <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> people, is among the first <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> people. This happens with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{k}{i-1}\)</span>. Hence the probability of Bob winning is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{n-k}{n} \sum_{i=k+1}^n \frac{1}{n-k} \cdot \frac{k}{i-1}
\approx \frac{k}{n}\ln (n/k),\]</span> where we have used the fact that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i=1}^n 1/i \approx \ln n\)</span> which can be seen by considering the integral of the function <span class="math inline">\(x\mapsto 1/x\)</span> and Reiman approximations to this integral, using rectangles of width <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we optimize <span class="math inline">\(-x\ln x\)</span>; the optimal value of <span class="math inline">\(k/n\)</span> will be adjacent to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> by monotonicity.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\frac{d}{dx} x\ln x = 1+\ln x.\]</span> Clearly the derivative of our function is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(x=1/e\)</span>.</p>
<p>Hence setting <span class="math inline">\(k \approx n/e\)</span> is the optimal setting for <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> large enough that our estimates have been resonable.</p>
<p>Another interesting fact is that the optima of <span class="math inline">\(-x\ln x\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(1/e\)</span>, meaning that Bob’s optimal strategy has about a <span class="math inline">\(36%\)</span> chance of succeeding, which all things considered is not bad.</p>
</div>
<p>This result will undoubedly prove incredibly useful for any reading this. The assumptions made in our model of dating are completly legitamite. One word of caution however, is that we have not considered the possibility that modifying Bob’s dating strategy could affect the distribution of people available for him to date. This minor concern is alleviated by Bob simply not advertising that he is following this strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Future work</strong>: It would be quite interesting to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy. Please contact the author if you are able to produce any such data.</p>
