<p>Read this if you are interested in any of the following questions: "what is a meausre space?", "what's a set in $\mathbb{R}$" that has no well defined inner-measure? / why do measure spaces need $\sigma$-Algebra's defined on them?", "what's a Lesbegue integral?", "what's Lesbegue's dominated convergence theorem?" (_note: work in progress_)

<p> I read a cool paper [Bilò, Davide, et al. “Cutting Bamboo Down to Size.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00168 (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00168) and wrote a little "summary" of it. | very chill and very awesome!

<p>I am going to try to read "The Probablistic Method" by Noga Alon and Joel H.
Spencer. The Probablistic Method, pioneered by Erdos, is a really interesting
way to think about combinatorics problems. Here is a high level overview of how
proofs by the probabilistic method go

<p>Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) is one of the most famous
NP-hard problems. Today, we are going to solve it really fast!
(well, really just approximate it to within a factor of 1.5, but
 still).
