# Math talk info

We are going to discuss RSA encryption and some modular arithmetic. We will discuss why and how this method of encryption is interesting and valid (and some vulnerabilities if time permits).

# further stuff

note none of the other stuff is finished yet, and furthermore this is by no means a full compilation of encryption techniques...
