A basic fact of linear algebra, which is surprisingly useful is 
$$V\subset W \iff V^{\perp}\superset W^{\perp}.$$

This is true because the linear functionals annhiliating $V$ are
less specific than the linear functionals annhilating both $V$ and
$W\setminus V$.

But this can be useful, for example, to show that a vector is in
some space.

Do you have any cute facts that are obvious but also super useful? Let me know!
