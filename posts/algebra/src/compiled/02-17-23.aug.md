The trace of a matrix is usually defined as the sum of the
diagonal entries of the matrix. That seems like a pretty random
number. That's kind of like writing down 

$$\det A = \sum_{\pi \in S_n} \prod_{i\in [n]} A_{i,\pi_i} \text{sgn}(\pi_i)$$
and then saying yeah this is of course a reasonable thing which
just happens to also be the volume of a parallelpiped spanned by
its columns, just happens to be intimately related to the shape
of the image / kernel of $A$, just happens to be the product
of eigenvalues $\prod \lambda_I$, just happens to be the unique multi-linear anti-symmetric form or whatever.

anyways, this isn't a rant about determinants, I'll leave that to
Axler. It's a rant about traces.

so what is a trace really?
Well it's commonly stated to be $\sum \lambda_i$ sum of
eigenvalues which at least makes it seem more obvious why this
would be a basis invariant property of a linear operator. But
that's still not very satisfying.

Here's a better definition of trace.

Consider $$V\otimes V^*.$$
What's the most natural function that you can define 
from $$V\otimes V^* \to \C.$$
Well. Say you have a term $v\otimes f$. There's really only one
thing you can do. $$v\otimes f \mapsto f(v).$$

ok, so what does this do?
Well. It turns out that this map is the trace that we defined
above!

To see why, fix a basis $e_j^T$ for $V^*$, and let's say that we
have some matrix $T\in V\otimes V^*$ which does $e_i \mapsto v^{(i)}.$
Then we can write $T$ as $$T=\sum_j v^{(j)}\otimes e_j^T.$$
This means that $Tw = \sum_j v^{(j)} w_j$.

And we can see that this operator that we defined evaluated on $T$ gives:
$$\sum_j  e_j^T v^{(j)} = \sum_j v^{(j)}_j$$
as advertised.

weird!
