<p>A basic fact of linear algebra, which is surprisingly useful is <span class="math display">\[V\subset W \iff V^{\perp}\superset W^{\perp}.\]</span></p>
<p>This is true because the linear functionals annhiliating <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> are less specific than the linear functionals annhilating both <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(W\setminus V\)</span>.</p>
<p>But this can be useful, for example, to show that a vector is in some space.</p>
<p>Do you have any cute facts that are obvious but also super useful? Let me know!</p>
