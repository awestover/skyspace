So what is rep theory?
It's taking a group $G$ and then associating linear maps (also
known as matrices if you are willing to fix a basis) to the group
elements in a "structure-preserving" way.
More specifically, it is a homomorphism
$$\phi: G \to GL(V)$$
This means $\phi(gh) \cdot v = \phi(g)\phi(h) \cdot v.$

IN this blog post I hope to introduce you to some of the
important theorems. But really if you want to learn rep theory
you gotta work some examples yourself.

<div class="ex envbox">**Example.**
find all the representations of $S_n$ up to isomorphism. 

- For $n=3$.
- For all $n$
</div>

ok so first, some definitions:

begin def
**$G$-invariant subspace**: subspace fixed by action of $G.$
i.e. $W\subset V$ such that $\phi(g) W = W$ for all $g\in G$.
end def

begin def 
**irreducible rep**: no proper $G$-invariant subspace
end def

<div class="rmk envbox">**Remark.**
In this blog post all groups are assumed to be finite, and all
vector spaces are over the complex numbers. Some stuff breaks if
we don't have these assumptions.
</div>

# shur

<div class="lem envbox">**Lemma.**
Let $\phi: G\to GL(V), \phi': G\to GL(V')$ be irreducible
$G$-representations. Let $T:V\to V'$ be a map that commutes with the
reps, i.e. $T\circ \phi = \phi'\circ T.$
Then $T$ is a scalar.
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
$\ker T$ is  $G$-invariant subspace, but not proper subspace
(none exist due to the irreducibility of the representations).
so the map is the zero-map or an isomorphism.

Take an eigenvector $\lambda$ of $T$ : this must exist due to us
working over the complex numbers.
Then we see that $T=\lambda I$.
</div>

# maschke

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
And representation can be decomposed as a direct sum of irreps
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
Define a $G$-invariant hermetian form on the space.
Then, if $W$ is $G$ invariant, $W^\perp$ is also $G$-invariant.
Thus, the rep decomposes into blocks as $W\oplus W^\perp$
</div>


# main

character: trace
character inner-product: hermetian thing

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
- num irreps (up to iso) is num conj classes
- irreps are orthonormal
- $\sum d_i^2 = |G|, d_i  | |G|$ where $d_{i}$ is the dimension
    of the $i$-th irrep.
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
class functions: constant on conj classes. characters are basis
for class functions.

bunch of complicated stuff

regular rep
</div>

# frobenius

**induction:** build a rep from a rep of a subgroup.
To do this you basically make a bunch of copies of the rep on the
subgroup and move around between them.
**restriction**: build a rep of a subgroup from a rep on the
group. you just take the restriction

 $$Hom(Res V, W)^H \cong Hom(V, Ind W)^G$$

And the formula also holds for characters.
