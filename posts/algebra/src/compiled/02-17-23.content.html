<p>The trace of a matrix is usually defined as the sum of the diagonal entries of the matrix. That seems like a pretty random number. That’s kind of like writing down</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\det A = \sum_{\pi \in S_n} \prod_{i\in [n]} A_{i,\pi_i} \text{sgn}(\pi_i)\]</span> and then saying yeah this is of course a reasonable thing which just happens to also be the volume of a parallelpiped spanned by its columns, just happens to be intimately related to the shape of the image / kernel of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, just happens to be the product of eigenvalues <span class="math inline">\(\prod \lambda_I\)</span>, just happens to be the unique multi-linear anti-symmetric form or whatever.</p>
<p>anyways, this isn’t a rant about determinants, I’ll leave that to Axler. It’s a rant about traces.</p>
<p>so what is a trace really? Well it’s commonly stated to be <span class="math inline">\(\sum \lambda_i\)</span> sum of eigenvalues which at least makes it seem more obvious why this would be a basis invariant property of a linear operator. But that’s still not very satisfying.</p>
<p>Here’s a better definition of trace.</p>
<p>Consider <span class="math display">\[V\otimes V^*.\]</span> What’s the most natural function that you can define from <span class="math display">\[V\otimes V^* \to \mathbb{C}.\]</span> Well. Say you have a term <span class="math inline">\(v\otimes f\)</span>. There’s really only one thing you can do. <span class="math display">\[v\otimes f \mapsto f(v).\]</span></p>
<p>ok, so what does this do? Well. It turns out that this map is the trace that we defined above!</p>
<p>To see why, fix a basis <span class="math inline">\(e_j^T\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(V^*\)</span>, and let’s say that we have some matrix <span class="math inline">\(T\in V\otimes V^*\)</span> which does <span class="math inline">\(e_i \mapsto v^{(i)}.\)</span> Then we can write <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> as <span class="math display">\[T=\sum_j v^{(j)}\otimes e_j^T.\]</span> This means that <span class="math inline">\(Tw = \sum_j v^{(j)} w_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>And we can see that this operator that we defined evaluated on <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> gives: <span class="math display">\[\sum_j  e_j^T v^{(j)} = \sum_j v^{(j)}_j\]</span> as advertised.</p>
