<p>The Beck Fiala theorem is a fundamental result in discrepancy theory. Basically it says, if you have a collection of subsets of a universe and each element of the universe shows up in a limited number of the sets in your collection then there is a 2-coloring of the universe such that all sets have a roughly equal number of red and blue elements.</p>
<p>In fact, it is convenient to think of the colors as <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>. We’ll let red be <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span> and blue be <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(x\in U\)</span> let <span class="math inline">\(\chi(x)\)</span> denote the color of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> if it has been assigned. For <span class="math inline">\(S\subset U\)</span> let <span class="math inline">\(\chi(S) = \sum_{x\in S}\chi(x)\)</span> be the discrepancy of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Remark.</strong> My notation is inspired by <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6081">this paper</a> which proves a truly insane bound: you can make the discrepency of every set smaller than <span class="math inline">\(2d-\log^* d\)</span>. The classic result is <span class="math inline">\(2d-2\)</span>. Now, to me its not actually clear whether <span class="math inline">\(\log^* d &gt; 2\)</span>. But presumably this is true if you had some really large <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> like <span class="math inline">\(2^{2^{2}}=16\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Fix “degree” <span class="math inline">\(d\in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> be a universe of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(S_1,S_2,\ldots, S_m \subset U\)</span> such that each <span class="math inline">\(x\in U\)</span> appears in at most <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> of the <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span>’s. Then there is a two-coloring of <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(disc(S_i) \le 2d-2\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong></p>
<p>We use a really cool “floating colors technique”. The idea is, we are going to start with all the colors being tentatively assigned <span class="math inline">\(\chi(x) = 0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in U\)</span>. Then we will repeatedly change the colors, always maintaining <span class="math inline">\(\chi(x) \in [-1,1]\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(x\in U\)</span>. In particular, we will do some change that causes some <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to change from <span class="math inline">\(\chi(x)\in (-1,1)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\chi(x) \in \{-1, 1\}\)</span>. We say that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s color is <strong>frozen</strong> once it is set to <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span>. After an element’s color is frozen we won’t change it any more. If <span class="math inline">\(\chi(x)\in (-1,1)\)</span> we say that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s color is <strong>floating</strong>, meaning that it has not yet been chosen.</p>
<p>Now we argue why it is possible to freeze colors. We say that a set is <strong>dangerous</strong> if it has more than <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> elements with floating colors in it. Let <span class="math inline">\(D\subset [m]\)</span> be the set of indices <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> is dangerous. Let <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> be the number of elements with floating colors.</p>
<p>We claim that <span class="math inline">\(|D|&lt; n_0.\)</span> You can think of it like this: each element with a floating color pays one dollar to each set that it is contained in. To be dangerous a set needs more than <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> dollars. The amount of money distributed is at most <span class="math inline">\(n_0 d\)</span> because each element is in at most <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> sets. So the number of dangerous sets is certainly smaller than <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>Consider the following set of constraints:</p>
<ul>
<li>For all <span class="math inline">\(i\in D\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\chi(S_i) = 0.\]</span> This is a set of <span class="math inline">\(|D|\)</span> constraints, and there are <span class="math inline">\(n_0\)</span> variables. That is, the system is undet-constrained. So there is at least a 1-dimensional space of solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>We start at some solution, which corresponds to a point with all the floating variables <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> being at points <span class="math inline">\(\chi(x)\in (-1,1)\)</span>. Then we travel along this degree of freedom until one of the floating <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>’s hits <span class="math inline">\(\chi(x) = \pm 1\)</span>. At this point we stop and freeze this <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Crucially all the remaining floating elements still have <span class="math inline">\(\chi(x) \in [-1,1]\)</span>. So we can repeat this process to neutralize all dangerous sets.</p>
<p>Note that once a set becomes not-dangerous we are guaranteed that, no-matter what the other <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> variables in it are set to, they can’t mess with its value by more than <span class="math inline">\(2t\)</span>.</p>
<p>So at the end the discrepencies will all be at most <span class="math inline">\(2t\)</span> or something as claimed ish.</p>
