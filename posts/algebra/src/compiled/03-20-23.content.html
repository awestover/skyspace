<p><strong>Lemma.</strong>  let <span class="math inline">\(v_1,\ldots,v_k \in \mathbb{Z}^n\)</span> be linearly-independent over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(v_1,\ldots, v_k\)</span> is linearly-independent over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>.</p>

<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> First, note that <span class="math inline">\(v_1,\ldots,v_k\)</span> being linearly-independent over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is equivalent to <span class="math inline">\(v_1,\ldots, v_k\)</span> being linearly-independent over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>. In particular, this is because if <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i\in [k]} \frac{a_i}{b_i} v_i = 0\)</span> for integers <span class="math inline">\(a_i,b_i\)</span> then <span class="math display">\[\sum_{i\in [k]} v_i a_i \prod_{j\neq i} b_j = 0\]</span> is an integer linear combination which is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, and if <span class="math inline">\(\sum a_i  v_i = 0\)</span> for integers <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> then because <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\subset\mathbb{Q}\subset \mathbb{R}\)</span> this is also a rational linear combination, or even a real linear combination.</p>
<p>Thus, it remains to show that <span class="math inline">\(v_1,\ldots, v_k\)</span> being linearly-independent over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> suffices to guarantee that they are linearly-independent over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>. Assume that there are <span class="math inline">\(c_i\in \mathbb{R}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i\in [k]}  c_i v_i = 0\)</span>; we aim to show that this is only possible if <span class="math inline">\(c_i=0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Consider the set <span class="math display">\[C = \left\{ q_{i} c_{i}\; : \;q_{i}\in \mathbb{Q} \right\},\]</span> i.e. the <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>-span of the <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span>’s. If we view <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> as a <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> vector space we see that there must be a basis <span class="math inline">\(b_1,\ldots, b_\ell \in \mathbb{R}\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\ell\leq k\)</span>. In particular, because this is a basis we can write each <span class="math inline">\(c_i\)</span> as a <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> linear combination of the basis elements, say <span class="math display">\[c_i =\sum_{j\in [\ell]} q_{i,j}b_j.\]</span> Now, substituting into the equation dictating that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{i\in  [k]}c_iv_i = 0\)</span> gives <span class="math display">\[\sum_i \sum_j q_{i,j}b_j v_i = \sum_j \left( \sum_i q_{i,j}
  v_i \right) b_j = 0.\]</span> Now considering this for each component of the vector gives <span class="math display">\[\sum_j \left( \sum_i q_{i,j} v_{i,k} \right) b_j = 0.\]</span> But this is a <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> linear combination of the basis elements <span class="math inline">\(b_j\)</span>, which are linearly-independent over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(\sum_i q_{i,j}v_{i,k}=0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. Then we also have <span class="math display">\[\sum_i q_{i,j}v_{i}=0\]</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. But this is a <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span> linear combination of <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span>’s, which are linearly-independent over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>, hence <span class="math inline">\(q_{i,j}=0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i,j\)</span>. But then <span class="math inline">\(c_i = 0\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, as desired.</p>
