<p>So what is rep theory? It’s taking a group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and then associating linear maps (also known as matrices if you are willing to fix a basis) to the group elements in a “structure-preserving” way. More specifically, it is a homomorphism <span class="math display">\[\phi: G \to GL(V)\]</span> This means <span class="math inline">\(\phi(gh) \cdot v = \phi(g)\phi(h) \cdot v.\)</span></p>
<p>IN this blog post I hope to introduce you to some of the important theorems. But really if you want to learn rep theory you gotta work some examples yourself.</p>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> find all the representations of <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> up to isomorphism.</p>
<ul>
<li>For <span class="math inline">\(n=3\)</span>.</li>
<li>For all <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>ok so first, some definitions:</p>
<div class="defn envbox">
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> <strong><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-invariant subspace</strong>: subspace fixed by action of <span class="math inline">\(G.\)</span> i.e. <span class="math inline">\(W\subset V\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\phi(g) W = W\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(g\in G\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>begin defin <strong>irreducible rep</strong>: no proper <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-invariant subspace end defin</p>

<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(\phi: G\to GL(V), \phi&#39;: G\to GL(V&#39;)\)</span> be irreducible <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-representations. Let <span class="math inline">\(T:V\to V&#39;\)</span> be a map that commutes with the reps, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(T\circ \phi = \phi&#39;\circ T.\)</span> Then <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a scalar.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(\ker T\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>-invariant subspace, but not proper subspace (none exist due to the irreducibility of the representations). so the map is the zero-map or an isomorphism.</p>
<p>Take an eigenvector <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> : this must exist due to us working over the complex numbers. Then we see that <span class="math inline">\(T=\lambda I\)</span>.</p>

<p>can we read the normal subgroups of a group off of its character table? good question! one idea is, well normal subgroups are unions of conjugacy classes, so take a bunch of unions of conjugacy classes. Lagrange’s theorem them (subgroups have order dividing order of the group). Then you would really have to check if it’s closed as far as I can tell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ok but here’s a better way.</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Normal subgroups appear as kernels of irreps</p>
<p><strong>EDIT: this is actually false</strong> Some normal subgroups will appear as kernels of irreps, but in general there may be many more normal subgroups than can possibly occur as kernels of irreps.</p>
</div>
First we need a lemma:
<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> For character <span class="math inline">\(\chi_\rho\)</span> of a dimension <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> irrep <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\chi(g)=\chi(e)=d \iff \rho_g = Id.\)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Say that we have a representation <span class="math inline">\(g\mapsto R_g\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(g^k=e\)</span> and thus of course <span class="math inline">\(R_g^k = I\)</span>. Clearly any eigenvector <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(R_g\)</span> satisfies <span class="math inline">\(R_g v = \lambda \implies R_g^k v = \lambda^k v = v \implies \lambda^k=1.\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th root of unity. The character of a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-dimensional irrep must be the sum of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> such eigenvalues.</p>
<p>In order for the sum to be <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> it must be the sum of all <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>’s. Only <span class="math inline">\(Id\)</span> has all eigenvalues being <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
</div>
Now we can get the theorem
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> act on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span> by the trivial action (doing nothing!). Now, consider the induced representation <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> (look down to see what this means.)</p>
<p><strong>the following stuff is kind of false; I have yet to completely understand why</strong> We claim that <span class="math inline">\(\ker \rho = H\)</span>. We can see this by Mackey’s formula, and the fact that <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is normal so conjugation fixes <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span>. Oh and we are also applying the lemma here.</p>
<p>Ok, then by Maschke’s theorem, we can write <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span> as a direct sum of irreps. But to be in the kernel of a direct sum you must be in the kernel of each (non-zero) summand.</p>
<p>Hence <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> is in the kernel of some non-zero number of the irreps.</p>

<p><strong>induction:</strong> build a rep from a rep of a subgroup. To do this you basically make a bunch of copies of the rep on the subgroup and move around between them. <strong>restriction</strong>: build a rep of a subgroup from a rep on the group. you just take the restriction</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Hom(\texttt{Res}_H^G V, W)^H \cong Hom(V, \texttt{Ind}_H^G W)^G\]</span></p>
<p>And the formula also holds for characters.</p>
<p>Also it is probably equivalent in some sense to Mackey’s formula <span class="math display">\[\chi_{ind}(g) = \frac{1}{|H|}\sum_{x\in G, xgx^{-1}\in H} \chi(xgx^{-1}).\]</span></p>

<p>ok we can construct the irreps of <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> by defining - young diagram: partition of n arranged into a left justified square diagram - tableux: put numbers in young diagram - tabloid: we don’t care about numbers order within rows - polytabloid: linear combo of tabloids</p>
<p>and then apparently polytabloids with the obvious group action of <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> corresponds to irreps of <span class="math inline">\(S_n.\)</span> crazy!</p>
