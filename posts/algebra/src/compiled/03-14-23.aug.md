A super important notion in linear algebra is that of
**duality**.
Put simply, duality is the following fact:

> there is an isomorphism between vectors and linear functionals

The lay-man's explanation of this is "the dual of a column vector
is a row vector, sometimes also called the transpose".
I don't think this really does the idea justice though.

The way I like to think about it is like this. Let's say that we
have a vector space $V$, with some basis $e_1,\ldots, e_n$. 
Then, the dual space $V^*$ is the set of linear-functionals on $V$. $V^{*}$ has a basis  $\hat{e_1}, \ldots,
\hat{e_n}$ which are the linear functionals that act as follows
on vectors $v=c_1 e_1 + c_2 e_2 + \cdots$: 
 $$\hat{e_i}(v) = c_i.$$

It's kinda interesting. Think about it a bit.

Let's see this in action, to solve the following problem:

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
$Im A = Im AA^T$
</div>

But actually this isn't the real theorem. The real theorem is:

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
Let $A: \R^n \to \R^m$, and $A^T : \R^m \to \R^n$. Then 

$$\ker A^{T} \oplus Im A \cong \R^m$$
$$\ker A \oplus Im A^T \cong \R^n.$$

and in-fact, $\ker A^T$ is the orthogonal complement of $Im A$;
similarly $\ker A$ is the orthogonal complement of  $Im A^T$.

</div>

This theorem immediately implies the other theorem via the
following picture

<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
Say $A^T y = 0$. Then  $y^T A = 0$, so  $y^T A x = 0$ for all $x$, i.e. $y \perp Ax$.
