<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidirect_product">wikipedia: probably more correct than whatever I say here</a></p>
<p>Ok so first, a reminder. Here is what the cyclic group looks like. It’s the group for addition modulo 5. <img src="ink_img001.png" alt="ink_img001" /> So the little points are the group elements and the arrows represent action of a generator <span class="math inline">\((+1)\)</span> on them.</p>
<p>OK, now let’s look at the direct product. <img src="ink_img003.png" alt="ink_img003" /></p>
<p>hmmm. I think this is a fine picture. <img src="ink_img004.png" alt="ink_img004" /> Maybe this is a better picture.</p>
<p>But you get the idea, you basically can move via two clocks at the same time.</p>

<p>Now what if we did a weird permutation in between? <img src="ink_img005.png" alt="ink_img005" /></p>
<p>so in this picture the outer-most square and the inner-most square are actually the same, but I didn’t want to draw too-dense arrows.</p>
<p>So what’s the deal with this weird product thing? Well.</p>
