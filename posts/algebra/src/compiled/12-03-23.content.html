<p><strong>Remark.</strong> A well known fact is that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_p^{*}\)</span>, the multipicative group of the integers modulo <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, is cyclic, i.e., has a generator.</p>
<p>For a short proof, recall that the number of elements of order <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> in a group is at most the number of solutions to <span class="math display">\[x^{d}\equiv 1 \mod p,\]</span> which is at most <span class="math inline">\(\phi(d)\)</span>. So we have: <span class="math display">\[p\le \sum_{d\mid (p-1)} \phi(d).\]</span></p>
<p>On the other hand, for any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[\sum_{d\mid n} \phi(d) = n\]</span> which can be seen by noting that <span class="math inline">\(\Pr_{x\gets[n]}[gcd(n,x) = \frac{n}{d}] = \phi(d)\)</span> which can be seen by listing the things which have <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n}{d} \mid gcd(n,x)\)</span>, namely <span class="math inline">\(\frac{n}{d},\frac{2n}{d},\frac{3n}{d}\ldots, \frac{dn}{d}\)</span> and then crossing out the ones which have additional divisors beyond <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Anyways, this means that the number of elements of order <span class="math inline">\(d\mid (p-1)\)</span> is really <span class="math inline">\(\phi(d)\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(d\mid (p-1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Anyways, but that’s not what I want to talk about.</p>

<p><strong>Remark.</strong> Another well-known fact is that for <span class="math inline">\(p\neq q\)</span> odd primes the group <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_{pq}^{*}\)</span> is not cyclic.</p>
<p>proof:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(g^{\lcm(p-1,q-1)}\equiv 1\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(g\in \mathbb{Z}_{pq}^{*}\)</span> but <span class="math inline">\(\lcm(p-1,q-1)&lt;(p-1)(q-1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Maybe one day I’ll think about even numbers. But for today lets assume they don’t exist.</p>
</div>
ok but what I actually wanted to talk about is this:
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> The group <span class="math inline">\(Z_{p^{k}}^{*}\)</span> is cyclic.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We proceed by induction. The base case will be <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(k=2\)</span> we have that <span class="math inline">\(|\mathbb{Z}_{p^{2}}^{*}| = p(p-1)\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> be a generator for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_p^{*}\)</span>, we showed above that this exists. Then <span class="math inline">\(p-1 \mid ord_{p^{2}}(\gamma)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(ord_{p^{2}}\)</span> denotes the order of an element in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_{p^{2}}^{*}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also observe <span class="math inline">\(ord_{p^{2}}(1+p) \equiv 0 \mod p.\)</span></p>
<p>But then <span class="math inline">\((1+p)\gamma\)</span> has order <span class="math inline">\(p(p-1)\)</span>. Proof of this claim: imagine <span class="math inline">\(p\mid ord(x),p-1\mid ord(y)\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\((xy)^{p}\notequiv 1, (xy)^{p-1}\notequiv 1\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(ord(xy)= p(p-1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we consider <span class="math inline">\(k&gt;2\)</span> by induction. To be continued after the semester ends…</p>
