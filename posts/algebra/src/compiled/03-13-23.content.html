<p>Finite fields are super great. But for some reason it seems that many people regard them as completely mysterious except for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/ p\mathbb{Z}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Today. I partially fix that. A little bit.</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_q\)</span> be a finite field with <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> elements. Then <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> must be a prime power.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> be the characterisitc of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_q\)</span>, i.e. the smallest <span class="math inline">\(p\in \mathbb{N}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p\cdot 1 = 1+ \cdots + 1\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> times is <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Note that the characteristic must be prime (because inverses exist in a field so <span class="math inline">\(ab=0\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(a,b\in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> would imply <span class="math inline">\(a=0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(b=0\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Now, consider the action of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_p\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_q.\)</span> We claim that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_q\)</span> is a <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_p\)</span> vector space. This is clearly true, because check the axioms yourself.</p>
<p>But then the size of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_q\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(p^{dim \mathbb{F}_q}\)</span>, as claimed.</p>
</div>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> be a degree <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> irreducible polynomial over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_p\)</span> for some prime <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_p[x] / (f)\)</span> is a finite field of size <span class="math inline">\(p^{k}.\)</span></p>
</div>
<p>beg pf The only suspect part is the existence of inverses really. Bezout’s theorem / euclidean algorithm says that for any polynomials <span class="math inline">\(f,g\)</span> there exists <span class="math inline">\(a,b\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(af + bg = gcd(f,g)\)</span>. But for irreducible polynomials this is saying there exists <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(bg \equiv 1 (f)\)</span>. As desired.</p>
<p>end pf</p>
<div class="rmk envbox">
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> Apparently an equivalent characterization can be made by looking at the roots of <span class="math inline">\(x^{p^{n}}-x = 0\)</span> with some appropriate definition of addition</p>
</div>
<h1 id="todo-later">todo later:</h1>
<p>In fact, a much stronger result holds: the field we defined above for <span class="math inline">\(p^{n}\)</span> is unique up to isomorphism.</p>
<p>Supposedly the following Lemma is helpful for establishing this: begin lemma The multiplicative group of a field is cyclic. end lemma</p>
