Ok so first, a reminder. Here is what the cyclic group looks
like. It's the group for addition modulo 5. 
![ink_img001](ink_img001.png)
So the little points are the group elements and the arrows
represent action of a generator $(+1)$ on them.

OK, now let's look at the direct product. 
![ink_img003](ink_img003.png)

hmmm. I think this is a fine picture.
![ink_img004](ink_img004.png)
Maybe this is a better picture. 

But you get the idea, you basically can move via two clocks at
the same time.

# semi-direct products
Now what if we did  a weird permutation in between?
![ink_img005](ink_img005.png)

so in this picture the outer-most square and the inner-most
square are actually the same, but I didn't want to draw too-dense
arrows.

So what's the deal with this weird product thing?
Well.
