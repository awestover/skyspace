<div class="lem envbox">**Lemma.**
  \label{lem:qvecspace}
  let $v_1,\ldots,v_k \in \Z^n$ be linearly-independent over
  $\Z$. Then  $v_1,\ldots, v_k$ is linearly-independent over
  $\R$.
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
  First, note that $v_1,\ldots,v_k$ being linearly-independent
  over $\Z$ is equivalent to  $v_1,\ldots, v_k$ being
  linearly-independent over $\Q$. In particular, this is because
  if $\sum_{i\in [k]} \frac{a_i}{b_i} v_i  = 0$ for integers $a_i,b_i$ then
  $$\sum_{i\in [k]} v_i a_i \prod_{j\neq i} b_j = 0$$
  is an integer linear combination which is $0$, and if $\sum a_i
  v_i = 0$ for integers $a_i$ then because $\Z\subset\Q\subset \R$ this is
  also a rational linear combination, or even a real linear
  combination. 

  Thus, it remains to show that $v_1,\ldots, v_k$ being
  linearly-independent over $\Q$ suffices to guarantee that they
  are linearly-independent over $\R$.
  Assume that there are $c_i\in \R$ such that  $\sum_{i\in [k]}
  c_i v_i = 0$; we aim to show that this is only possible if
  $c_i=0$ for all $i$.
  Consider the set 
  $$C = \setof{q_{i} c_{i}}{q_{i}\in \Q},$$
  i.e. the $\Q$-span of the $c_i$'s.
  If we view $\R$ as a $\Q$ vector space we see that there must
  be a basis $b_1,\ldots, b_\ell \in \R$ for $C$ with $\ell\leq k$. In
  particular, because this is a basis we can write each  $c_i$ as
  a $\Q$ linear combination of the basis elements, say
  $$c_i =\sum_{j\in [\ell]} q_{i,j}b_j.$$
  Now, substituting into the equation dictating that $\sum_{i\in
  [k]}c_iv_i = 0$ gives
  $$\sum_i \sum_j q_{i,j}b_j v_i = \sum_j \paren{\sum_i q_{i,j}
  v_i} b_j = 0.$$
  Now considering this for each component of the vector gives
  $$\sum_j \paren{\sum_i q_{i,j} v_{i,k}} b_j = 0.$$
  But this is a $\Q$ linear combination of the basis elements
  $b_j$, which are linearly-independent over  $\Q$. Thus,
  $\sum_i q_{i,j}v_{i,k}=0$ for all $j$.
  Then we also have
  $$\sum_i q_{i,j}v_{i}=0$$ for all $j$.
  But this is a $\Q$ linear combination of  $v_i$'s, which are
  linearly-independent over $\Q$, hence $q_{i,j}=0$ for all
  $i,j$.
  But then $c_i = 0$ for all  $i$, as desired.
