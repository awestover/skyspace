some basic rep theory
{body}

So what is rep theory?
It's taking a group $G$ and then associating linear maps (also
known as matrices if you are willing to fix a basis) to the group
elements in a "structure-preserving" way.
More specifically, it is a homomorphism
$$\phi: G \to GL(V)$$
This means $\phi(gh) \cdot v = \phi(g)\phi(h) \cdot v.$

IN this blog post I hope to introduce you to some of the
important theorems. But really if you want to learn rep theory
you gotta work some examples yourself.

begin ex
find all the representations of $S_n$ up to isomorphism. 

- For $n=3$.
- For all $n$
end ex

ok so first, some definitions:

begin def
**$G$-invariant subspace**: subspace fixed by action of $G.$
i.e. $W\subset V$ such that $\phi(g) W = W$ for all $g\in G$.
end def

begin def 
**irreducible rep**: no proper $G$-invariant subspace
end def

begin rmk
In this blog post all groups are assumed to be finite, and all
vector spaces are over the complex numbers. Some stuff breaks if
we don't have these assumptions.
end rmk

# shur

begin lem
Let $\phi: G\to GL(V), \phi': G\to GL(V')$ be irreducible
$G$-representations. Let $T:V\to V'$ be a map that commutes with the
reps, i.e. $T\circ \phi = \phi'\circ T.$
Then $T$ is a scalar.
end lem
begin pf
$\ker T$ is  $G$-invariant subspace, but not proper subspace
(none exist due to the irreducibility of the representations).
so the map is the zero-map or an isomorphism.

Take an eigenvector $\lambda$ of $T$ : this must exist due to us
working over the complex numbers.
Then we see that $T=\lambda I$.
end pf

# maschke

begin thm
And representation can be decomposed as a direct sum of irreps
end thm
begin pf 
Define a $G$-invariant hermetian form on the space.
Then, if $W$ is $G$ invariant, $W^\perp$ is also $G$-invariant.
Thus, the rep decomposes into blocks as $W\oplus W^\perp$
end pf


# main

character: trace
character inner-product: hermetian thing

begin thm
- num irreps (up to iso) is num conj classes
- irreps are orthonormal
- $\sum d_i^2 = |G|, d_i  | |G|$ where $d_{i}$ is the dimension
    of the $i$-th irrep.
end thm
begin pf
class functions: constant on conj classes. characters are basis
for class functions.

bunch of complicated stuff

regular rep
end pf

# frobenius

**induction:** build a rep from a rep of a subgroup.
To do this you basically make a bunch of copies of the rep on the
subgroup and move around between them.
**restriction**: build a rep of a subgroup from a rep on the
group. you just take the restriction

 $$Hom(Res V, W)^H \cong Hom(V, Ind W)^G$$

And the formula also holds for characters.
