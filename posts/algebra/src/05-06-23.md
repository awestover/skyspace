If you know a better proof of this result, please contact me. 

beg lem
$$\sum_{d|n} \phi(d) = n.$$
end lem
beg pf
By induction:
$$\sum_{d|p^{k}m}\phi(d) = \sum_{i=0}^{k}\sum_{d|m}\phi(p^{i}d)
= \sum_{i=0}^{k}\sum_{d|m}\phi(d) \phi(p^{i}).$$
But this is telescoping because $\phi(p^{i})=p^{i}-p^{i-1}$.
It tellescopes to 
$$p^{k}\sum_{d|m}\phi(d) = p^{k}m,$$
by induction.

beg thm
The multiplicative group of $\F_p$ is cyclic.

In fact, this is true of any finite field by a similar proof.
end thm
beg pf
For each $d|p-1$, there are at most $\phi(d)$ elements of $\F_p$
which have order $d$.
Thus, by the lemma above, for each $d|p-1$ there are exactly
$\phi(d)$ elements of $\F_p$ with order  $d$. In particular,
$\phi(p-1)>0$, so there is some element with order $p-1$, i.e. a
generator.
