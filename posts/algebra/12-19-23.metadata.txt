the power of linear-dependence

One of the most basic facts of linear algebra is that whenever
you have $n+1$ vectors in an $n$-dimensional vectors space, there
must be one of your vectors which can be expressed as a linear
combination of the other vectors. This seemingly simple fact can
prove some really interesting combinatorial statements.
