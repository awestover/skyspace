Bela Fleck Theorem

The Beck Fiala theorem is a fundamental result in discrepancy
theory. Basically it says, if you have a collection of subsets of a
universe and each element of the universe shows up in a limited
number of the sets in your collection then there is a 2-coloring
of the universe such that all sets have a roughly equal number of red and blue elements.
