        <div id="actual-content"><h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>To introduce the subject of the paper we begin with the illustrative example of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring a random graph.</p>
<p>The random <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring problem is defined as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a random graph with average degree <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>. Is it possible to properly <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-color the vertices of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>?</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="rmk envbox">
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> Throughout the note we will use the “configuration model” of random graphs: namely, we randomly sample a graph from the set of all graphs with <span class="math inline">\(nd/2\)</span> edges. However, morally this is quite similar to an Erd"os-Renyi graph with the same edge density.</p>
</div>
<p>The answer to this existential problem is, that there is a threshold at <span class="math inline">\(d=2k\ln k\)</span>.</p>
<div class="prop envbox">
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(d&gt; (2+\varepsilon)k\ln k\)</span> then the answer is almost certainly no [TODO: prove]. On the other hand, a second moment method calculation [TODO: do it] shows that if <span class="math inline">\(d&lt;(2-\varepsilon)k\ln k\)</span> then with probability <span class="math inline">\(1-o(1)\)</span> [TODO: is the probability expo good?] <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-colorable.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> The proof of existence of a solution is non-constructive: we use the second moment method.</p>
</div>
A closely related algorithmic question is to give an efficient algorithm for finding a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring of a random graph. The state-of-the-art for this problem is:
<div class="prop envbox">
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> If <span class="math inline">\(d&lt;k\ln k\)</span> then there is an efficient algorithm for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> The algorithm is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>while not all vertices are colored:
  Let v be a vertex with the fewest remaining choices for its color
  Assign v a random available color</code></pre>
<p>[TODO: prove that this works]</p>
</div>
<p>Let the <strong>algorithmic threshold</strong> denote the largest edge density where we have efficient algorithms for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring. Let the <strong>existence threshold</strong> denote the largest edge density where we are guaranteed (with good probability) that a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring exists. Note that there is a gap between the algorithmic threshold and the existence threshold. This is a quite general phenomenon across many CSPs; for instance it also occurs for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-SAT. Achiloptas and Coja-Oghlan’s goal in this paper is to provide an explanation of the gap between these thresholds. They do so by giving a description of the solution space geometry, and showing that this space undergoes a dramatic change when we cross the threshold below which we have efficient algorithms for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring.</p>
<p>First we define what we mean by solution space geometry, and describe qualitatively the phase transition that occurs. The space of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-colorings is simply <span class="math inline">\([k]^{n}\)</span>. We can think of this as a “landscape”. The <strong>height</strong> in the landscape corresponds to the number of violated constraints (i.e., monochromatic edges). The <strong>height</strong> of a path between two colorings is the largest height at any coloring along the path. The <strong>distance</strong> between two colorings is the number of vertices that they assign different colors. Below the algorithmic threshold they show that there is a “giant ball” of solutions: this ball is large, and it is easy to move between solutions, in the sense that starting from a given solution there is a nearby solution that you can walk to along a low height path. In contrast, above the algorithmic threshold (but still below the existence threshold so that solutions exist) the solution space <strong>shatters</strong> and looks like an “error correcting code”. More specifically, the solution space transitions to consisting of an exponential number of regions, none of which are very large, and such that the regions are very far apart and separated by large heights (or “energy barriers”).</p>
<p>The most important idea in their analysis is a <strong>transfer principle</strong>. Roughly speaking this principle says that the view of the landscape from a random valley is basically the same as the view from a <strong>planted</strong> valley. In a <strong>planted</strong> instance of random <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring instead of uniformly randomly choosing a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> of appropriate average degree, we first fix a coloring <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\in [k]^{n}\)</span> and then select <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> from amongst graphs with the appropriate average degree which are properly colored by <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. Intuitively, if a random coloring instance has a very large number of solutions on average then adding one more solution won’t change its landscape too much. However, reasoning about the planted model turns out to be <em>much</em> easier than reasoning about the uniform model.</p>
<p>Now we develop these notions more formally. For graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and coloring <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\in [k]^{n}\)</span> let <span class="math inline">\(H_G(\sigma)\)</span> count the number of violated constraints (monochromatic edges) if we color <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> via <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(S(G)\)</span> denote the set of colorings <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> with height <span class="math inline">\(H_G(\sigma) = 0\)</span>; that is, <span class="math inline">\(S(G)\)</span> is the set of proper <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-colorings of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Define the <strong>distance</strong> between two colorings to be the number of vertices which they assign different colors. A <strong>cluster</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a connected component of <span class="math inline">\(S(G)\)</span>, where two colorings are considered <strong>adjacent</strong> if they have distance <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (differ on a single vertex). A <strong>region</strong> is a non-empty union of clusters.</p>
Then, the <strong>shattering</strong> phenomenon can be formalized as follows:
<div class="defn envbox">
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> There exists a partition of <span class="math inline">\(S(G)\)</span> into regions such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of regions is at most <span class="math inline">\(\exp(\beta n)\)</span>,</li>
<li>The distance between distinct regions is at least <span class="math inline">\(\zeta n\)</span>,</li>
<li>All paths between distinct regions have height at least <span class="math inline">\(\theta  n\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
They show:
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Shattering happens right above the algorithm threshold for <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring.</p>
</div>
<p>Fix graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and a proper <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. We say that a vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is <strong><span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span>-rigid</strong> (with respect to <span class="math inline">\(G,\sigma\)</span>) if every coloring <span class="math inline">\(\tau\in S(G)\setminus \left\{ \sigma\right\}\)</span> is distance at least <span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span> away from <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. Otherwise we say that vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is <strong><span class="math inline">\(f(n)\)</span>-loose</strong>. They show:</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Below the algorithm threshold all variables are loose (with good probability). Above the algorithm threshold most variables are rigid.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="proof-sketches">proof sketches</h1>
<p>Now we present proof sketches for these theorems.</p>
<p>The most important part of the argument is the <strong>transfer principle</strong>, i.e., showing that we can understand the view from a random solution by looking at the view from a planted solution.</p>
To get some intuition for the transfer principle it is useful to look at a simpler but morally similar case.
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> be a binary matrix with <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> ones in each row and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> ones in each column. Consider the following two distributions over ones in the matrix:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Sample a random row and then choose a random one in that row.</li>
<li>Sample a random column and then choose a random one in that column.</li>
</ol>
<p>Clearly both of these methods for sampling produce the uniform distribution over ones in <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, suppose that we construct matrix <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> as follows: Fix a number <span class="math inline">\(N\in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> denote the set of all <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-colorings of vertex set <span class="math inline">\([n]\)</span> where each color is used exactly <span class="math inline">\(n/k\)</span> times. <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{X}\)</span> will index the rows of <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> denote the set of all graphs <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(nd\)</span> vertices that can be properly <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-colored in exactly <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> different ways by colorings <span class="math inline">\(\chi\in \mathcal{X}\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{G}\)</span> will index the columns of <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span>. We put a one in entry <span class="math inline">\((\chi\in \mathcal{X}, G\in\mathcal{G})\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> is a proper coloring of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>By symmetry, each row of <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> has the same number of ones in it. By definition each graph <span class="math inline">\(G\in\mathcal{G}\)</span> permits exactly <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> colorings <span class="math inline">\(\chi\in \mathcal{X}\)</span>. Thus, each column of <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> also has the same number of ones in it.</p>
<p>Now, in the same manner as our earlier thought experiment we can define two equivalent ways of uniformly randomly sampling a <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> in the matrix.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>First choose a random graph <span class="math inline">\(G\in \mathcal{G}\)</span> and then sample a random coloring <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> from among all <span class="math inline">\(\chi\in \mathcal{X}\)</span> that properly color <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</li>
<li>First choose a random coloring <span class="math inline">\(\chi\in\mathcal{X}\)</span> and then sample a random graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> from among all graphs <span class="math inline">\(G\in\mathcal{G}\)</span> properly colored by <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first option corresponds to considering the view from a random solution, while the second option corresponds to considering a view from a planted solution. In this situation the two distributions defined are identical.</p>
<p>However, this matrix <span class="math inline">\(M&#39;\)</span> is not the distribution we actually want to sample from. Rather we are interested in the following distribution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sample a random graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> with average degree <span class="math inline">\(d&lt;(2-\varepsilon)k\ln k\)</span>. Then, sample a random proper coloring of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> (assuming one exists, which it does with good probability).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This distribution over <span class="math inline">\(G,\chi\)</span> pairs is quite complex however, and it would be more convenient to study the following distribution:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose a random coloring <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> and then choose a random graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that is properly colored by <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their transfer principle gives a very precise sense in which these distributions are similar.</p>
</div>
In order to prove the transfer principle they need the following lemma:
<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(G_{n,m}\)</span> be a random graph with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> edges and let <span class="math inline">\(S(G)\)</span> denote the number of proper <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-colorings of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Then, with high probability we have <span class="math display">\[ \ln(|S(G_{n,m})|) - \ln \mathop{\mathrm{\mathbb{E}}}(S(G_{n,m})) &lt; o(n). \]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> [TODO: do stuff here]</p>
<p>The proof combines analysis of the second moment <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{\mathbb{E}}}[|S(G_{n,m})|^2]\)</span> with theorems of Freidgut concerning sharp thresholds.</p>
</div>
<p>To state the transfer principle we must first formally define the distributions we are concerned with. First, define the <strong>uniform model</strong> <span class="math inline">\(U_{n,m}\)</span> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sample a random graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> edges, and then sample a random proper <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> (assuming that one exists). Output <span class="math inline">\((G, \chi)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, define the <strong>planted model</strong> <span class="math inline">\(P_{n,m}\)</span> as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Generate a uniformly random <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-partition <span class="math inline">\(\chi\in [k]^n\)</span>. Choose a uniformly random subset of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> edges from amongst the edges that are not monochromatic under <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span>. Output <span class="math inline">\((G, \chi)\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
Then, the <strong>transfer theorem</strong> says:
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(d = 2m/n \le (2-\varepsilon)k\ln k\)</span>. There exists <span class="math inline">\(f(n)=o(n)\)</span> such that the following is true. Let <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> be any graph property such that <span class="math inline">\(G_{n,m}\)</span> has <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> with probability <span class="math inline">\(1-o(1)\)</span> and let <span class="math inline">\(E\)</span> be any property of pairs <span class="math inline">\(G,\chi\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> properly colors <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Suppose that <span class="math display">\[ \Pr_{P_{n,m}}[(G, \sigma) \text{ has } E \mid G \text{ has } D]\ge 1-\exp(-f(n)). \]</span> Then, <span class="math display">\[ \Pr_{U_{n,m}}[(G,\sigma) \text{ has } E] \ge 1-o(1). \]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> [TODO: why does this follow from the concentration of solutions that we saw above]</p>
</div>
<p>In the remainder of the note we will show how to use the transfer principle to prove their results about loose/rigid variables and about shattering/non-shattering.</p>
<h2 id="loose-variables-below-the-algorithm-threshold">Loose Variables Below the Algorithm Threshold</h2>
<p>In this section we show that below the algorithm threshold with good probability all variables are loose. Recall what this means: for any proper coloring <span class="math inline">\(\chi\)</span> of our graph and any vertex <span class="math inline">\(i\in [n]\)</span> we want to exhibit a “nearby” coloring <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> – nearby in the sense that we want <span class="math inline">\(\tau,\chi\)</span> to assign different colors to at most <span class="math inline">\(o(n)\)</span> vertices – with <span class="math inline">\(\tau(i)\neq \chi(i)\)</span>. To show this we give a simple algorithm that give <span class="math inline">\(\chi,i\)</span> finds such a nearby coloring where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>’s color is flipped.</p>
<p>The analysis of the algorithm will use notion of <strong>list chromatic number</strong>. We say that graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is <strong><span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>-list-colorable</strong> if for any set of color lists <span class="math inline">\(C_1,\ldots, C_n \in \binom{[k]}{\eta}\)</span> there exists a proper coloring <span class="math inline">\(\chi_1,\ldots, \chi_n\)</span> of the vertices with <span class="math inline">\(\chi_i \in C_i\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. We remark that the list-chromatic number of a graph (the smallest <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>-list-colorable) is at least as large, and possibly larger, than the chromatic number of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now we define the properties <span class="math inline">\(D,E\)</span> which we will use in the transfer principle.</p>
<p>Algo for finding a nearby solution: awake, asleep, dead vertices. subcritical branching process!</p>
<p>Then use the list-chromatic thing to handle the dead guys.</p>
<h2 id="rigid-vars-above-thresh">Rigid vars above thresh</h2>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> There is a big subgraph <span class="math inline">\(G_*\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> with the property that every vertex has a lot of neighbors of each other color.</p>
</div>
We use the transfer property to trade for a problem in planted model.
<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> solve planted version</p>
</div>
<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> bound on expansion</p>
</div>
<div class="cor envbox">
<p><strong>Corollary.</strong> It’s pretty easy to show from the theorem that no vertex in <span class="math inline">\(G_*\)</span> can have a close coloring.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="shattering">shattering</h2>
<p>Now we will prove shattering. They want some notion of distance that plays nicely with permuting colors, not exactly sure why but whatever.</p>
<p>Define <span class="math inline">\(M_{\sigma,\tau}^{ij} = \frac{1}{n} |\sigma^{-1}(i)\cap \tau^{-1}(j)|\)</span>. Our notion of distance between <span class="math inline">\(\sigma, \tau\)</span> is now gonna be frobenius norm of <span class="math inline">\(M_{\sigma, \tau}\)</span>. Checking for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = \tau\)</span> it is much bigger than if <span class="math inline">\(\sigma,\tau\)</span> are “uncorrelated”.</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> shattering. more specifically,</p>
<p>there are zero solutions at medium distance from <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. There are not so many solutions which are pretty close to <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>It is clear how this allows us to define regions.</p>
<p>ok so to prove the theorem</p>
<p>step 1: transfer principle ofc.</p>
