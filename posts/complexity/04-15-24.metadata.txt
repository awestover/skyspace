random coloring

For my stochastic processes final project I'm reading a paper
about understanding the solution geometry of random coloring
instances. The paper is:
Dimitris Achlioptas, and Amin Coja-Oghlan. "Algorithmic barriers from phase transitions." 2008 49th Annual IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science. IEEE, 2008.
I think it's quite neat. 
In this post I will organize some thoughts that I had after
reading the proof sketches.
