# reductions between square/triangle and k-cycle

Henceforth $C_4$ will be refered to as a "square" sometimes.

Proof from Appendix of Aboud FOCS22. 
"Hardness of approximation in P via short-cycle removal"

They prove two interesting theorems:

beg thm
- For any $k\in \N$ there is an $O(m)$ time algorithm that, on 
    an $m$-edge graph $G$ produces a graph $G^{\star}$ whose
    $4k$-cycles are in bijection with $G$'s $4$-cycles.
- For any $k\ge 3$ not a power of $2$, there is an $O(m)$ time
    algorithm that, on an $m$-edge graph $G$ produces a
    graph $G^{\star}$ such that $G$'s triangles are in bijection
    with $G^{\star}$'s $k$-cycles.
end thm

beg cor

- If $k$-cycle can be solved in $m^{\alpha}$ time for any
$k,\alpha$, then for at least one of $k_0\in \{3,4\}$ we can
solve $k$-cycle detection in $m^{\alpha}$ time.
- If there is an algorithm that with $O(m^{\alpha})$
    preprocessing lists $k$-cycles with $m^{o(1)}$ delay, then
    there is also such an algorithm for at least one of triangle
    / square enumeration.
end cor

beg cor
The result of Jin Xu STOC23 implies that there is no
$m^{4/3-o(1)}$ preprocessing followed by tiny delays algorithm
for $2k$-cycle listing.
But this is of course kind of weaker than what we believe to be
the truth.
end cor

ok now lets see some proofs:

<blob>

> "pfs vg!" -Blobby

beg lem
Let $r\mid k$.
$G \to G'$, such that $C_r\leftrightarrow C_k$
end lem
beg pf
Subdivide the edges. i.e., replace the edges with paths of length
$k/r$.
end pf

beg lem
Let $k$ be odd. 
There is an $O(m)$ time algorithm that takes a tripartite graph $G$ and converts it into $G^{\star}$ so that triangles in $G$ are in bijection with $k$-cycles in $G^{\star}$.
end lem
beg pf
Exchange each $B\times C$ edge for a path of length $k-2$, i.e.,
subdivide those edges.

It is clear that triangles get converted into $k$-cycles.
To see the other direction it is helpful to partition the vertex
set into $A,B,C, D_1,D_2,\ldots, D_{k-3}$ where $D_i$ is the
vertices which are  $i$ steps along a $B\to C$ path.

Observe that if we delete any of these parts the graph becomes
bipartite, and then we could certainly not find a $k$-cycle in
it. Hence every $k$-cycle must actually use one of the $B \times
C$ path / edge things and thus actually corresponds to a triangle
in the original graph.

end pf


# 4cycle listing

"Listing 4-Cycles" Abboud et al
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.10022.pdf

beg prop 
You can list squares in $O(n^{2}+t)$ time, where $t$ is number
of squares.
end prop
beg pf
Do a 2 step BFS out of every vertex. For each pair $u,v$ make a
list of the paths of length $2$ between $u,v$.

Then itterate over $u,v$ and itterate over pairs of paths of
length $2$ between $u, v$: each of these is a four-cycle. 
end pf

beg thm 
You can list squares in $\widetilde{O}(m^{4/3}+t)$ time, where
$t$ is number of squares.
end thm
beg pf
Some kindof high-degree low-degree construction. 
One of the cases "LHH" seems trickier.
