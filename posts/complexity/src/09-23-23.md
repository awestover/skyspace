SAT notes: Demaine Fun with Hardness
{contents}

{description}
We talked about a lot of special cases of SAT that are NP-hard in
Erik Demaine's Fun with Hardness class. I have had a hard time
keeping track of them all so I've created this little condensed
reference for all the various versions.

I briefly comment on some intuition for recognizing special cases
of SAT which are solvable in polynomial time

- 2SAT / Horn SAT : implication following
- clauses can be phrased as linear equations mod 2 can be solved by gaussian elimination
- DP can solve some nested things
- euler tour can solve some weird cases
