# trick:
"arithmetize" the boolean circuit.
This means extend it to be a function over the integers.
$$x\land y = x\cdot y, x\lor y = x+y-xy$$

# lit
"while two boolean functions might only disagree in a single
place, if you arithmetize different boolean functions they are
gonna disagree in a lot of places. That's because Polynomials
aren't too bouncy."
