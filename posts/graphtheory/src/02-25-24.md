random APSP ideas from graphalg lecture notes
{contents}

{description}
I reread a few lecture notes from virginia's graph algo class
specifically focussing on ones that seemed vaguely related to
APSP.

In this blog post $O$ generally means "ignoring both constants
and logarithmic factors".
I'm not saying log-shaving isn't interesting here. It could be.
Just not atm.

Suppose you were really clever and thought you found a really
fast $\cdot 1.9$ approximation algorithm for APASP, where fast
means faster then matrix multiplication. Then actually that's
impossible.

# some APSP stuff

weird idea:
 
- if two vertices have a *really long* shortest path between
    them, them you can take a hitting set of size large enough
    that it'll hit a vertex on the path :O. Now that's crazy.
- if two vertices have a fairly short longest path between them
    then you can catch it with MM.

beg prop
You can do APSP in directed unweighted graphs in $n^{(\omega+3)/2}$ time.
end prop
beg pf
Throughout proof $c=2.37$ denotes the current best value of $\omega$.
Set $k=n^{(3-c)/2}\approx n^{.35}$.
Find short long paths in time $kn^{c} \approx n^{2.7}$ just via
successive MM.
Do hitting sets for paths of length longer than $k$ which costs
$n^{3}/k \approx n^{2.7}$.

Overall cost is $n^{(3+c)/2}$.

end pf

This might seem supa slow. But it's impressive that it handles
directed graphs: directed graphs are pretty hard.

# Seidel's Algorithm
Now we focus on undirected graphs, and give an $O(n^{\omega}\log
n)$ algorithm.

interesting observation:
Suppose that $u$ is a neighbor of $v$. 
Then for any other vertex $w$ we have $d(w, v) \in d(w, u)+[-1,1]$.
In particular $d(w,v)\equiv d(w,u)\mod 2\implies d(w,v)=d(w,u)$.

I think this is important in Seidel's $O(n^{\omega}\log n)$-time
APSP alg. 
Like I think his alg is you repeatedly square the adjacency
matrix and then some how compute parity of path lengths using
some corollaries of the above observation and MM.

# additive graph spanners

beg thm
+2 spanner with $n^{3/2}$ edges.
end thm
beg pf
So a graph spanner is a (hopefully) sparse subgraph that
approximately preserves distance information.

This one is exactly what you would expect: 
keep edges incident to vertices of degree smaller than
$\sqrt{n}$, and take all edges out of a random hitting set of
size $\sqrt{n}$.
end pf

beg rmk
Let $P$ be a shortest path. 
Then any vertex has at most $3$ neighbors on $P$. 
end rmk

beg rmk
If shortest path $P$ has at least $L$ nodes of degree at least $D$ then there are $\Omega(LD)$ distinct neighbors of the path $P$.
end rmk


beg rmk
Very interesting: [due to Abboud]

There exist graphs that don't admit $n^{4/3-\eps}$ edge spanners
with additive error $+\O(1)$.

In fact, there are graphs such that any $n^{4/3-\eps}$ edge
subgraph has additive error at least $n^{\delta}$.
end rmk

beg thm
There is a $+4$ spanner with $O(n^{7/5})$ edges.

**TODO**: It is open whether you can do $n^{4/3}$ here.
end thm

beg pf
We have two parameters: $L, D$. $D$ is a degree threshold: higher
than D degree is high degree, lower than $D$ is low degree.
L is a number  of high degree vertices on a path before we
consider that path **fancy**.

Our spanner is as follows: (rmk this is existential not an algo)

Let $S$ be of size $n/D$ be a hitting set for high degree
vertices. 
Let $T$ be of size $n/(DL)$ be  a hitting set for fancy paths.
(i.e., every fancy path has a neighbor in $T$).
For high degree vertex $x$ let $r(x)$ be the representative of $x$ in $S$. i.e., an arbitrarily chosen neighbor of $x$ in $S$.

- Take all edges incident to low degreee vertices. Cost $nD$
- Take full BFS trees out of all vertices in $T$. Cost
    $n^2/(DL)$.
- Take $(x, r(x))$ edges for each high degree $x$.
- For each pair of distinct vertices $s,s'$ in  $S$, let $P_{s,s'}$ be the set of all non-fancy shortest paths between a neighbor of $s$ and a neighbor of $s'$. 
  - Let $p^{*}$ denote the shortest path in $P_{s, s'}$. Add edges
    from the endpoints of  $p^{*}$ to $s,s'$ based on where the
    endpoints of $p^{*}$ came from.
  - Now take all the edges in path $p^{*}$. I guess you don't
      need to take edges that we've already taken, in particular,
      let's not re-take edges touching low degree vertices.
  - With this convention the total number of edges taking to do
      this $s,s'$ link is $O(L)$. 
  - Thus overall this step takes $O((n/D)^2 L)$ edges.

Set $L=n^{1/5}, D = n^{2/5}.$ Then this is the desired sparsity. 

**claim** this is a $+4$ spanner.
proof:

It's pretty clear that this can take care of fancy paths and take
care of paths with no high degree vertices. 
Remaining case is paths with non-zero, but also non-alot many high degree vertices.
This is explained in the following picture.

beg thm
There is a $+6$ spanner with $O(n^{4/3})$ edges.
Clearly by the remark above you can't hope to do any sparser than
this.

# multiplicative graph spanners

beg thm
Every $n$ vertex graph contains a $(2k-1)$-spanner
(multiplicative approx to distances) with $O(n^{1+1/k})$ edges. 
This is tight assuming Erdos girth conjecture.
end thm
