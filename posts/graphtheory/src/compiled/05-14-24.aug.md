# remarks before the survey

<div class="rmk envbox">**Remark.**
This paper uses the convention I dislike for $k$-paths, 
i.e., they call a path with $3$ edges a $P_4$.
I **do not adopt this convention**. 
For me a path with $3$ edges is called a $P_3$. You have been
warned.
</div>

<div class="rmk envbox">**Remark.**
"Universal algorithm for induced SI":
$n^{k\omega}$ time to detect a $3k$ vertex pattern.

You compute this huge $3$-partite graph where vertices are
labelled $k$-vertex subsets.
Then you run triangle detection on this massive graph.
</div>

Now for a discussion of their results.
<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
Combinatorial $O(n^{k-2})$ algo for induced $P_k,C_k$ problems.
</div>

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
For a couple specific values of $k\in [5,9]$ they are
able to boost the MM based algo for $P_k,C_k$'s by doing their
arithmetic circuits with matrices. But they weren't able to get
this in full generality.
</div>

<div class="rmk envbox">**Remark.**
Oh, apparently Virginia had some algorithms for, e.g., $K_k-e$
that run in time  $O(n^{k-1})$. Worth reading at some point.

Seems like these guys also do something impressive about SI
[nk-1 SI for lots of graphs](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304397515007914?via%3Dihub)
they prove some conditional lower bounds too. 

Maybe also relevant is the paper "Finding Four-Node Subgraphs in
Triangle Time" where Virginia et al show how to do all $4$-vertex
patterns.
</div>

# introduction / motivation

A very cool and very classic algorithm that I've discussed
previously on this blog is Ryan Williams' $k$-path subgraph
isomorphism algorithm.

I may have just stated it for hamiltonicity, but it works for
general $k$.

The idea is as follows.
You write down a polynomial with terms corresponding to
possible homomorphic copies of the pattern in your graph.
And then you hope that it's easy to evaluate and that whether or
not it is identically zero can tell you something about it.

Ok, you might say, but what does this have to do with **induced**
paths/cycles?

You can write some polynomial like this:

$$ I_{P_3,n} = \prod_{a,b,c,d\mid a<d} x_{a,b}x_{b,c}x_{c,d} (1-x_{a,c})(1-x_{a,d})(1-x_{b,d}) $$ 

Here's a picture of expanding this:
![ink_img006](src/images/ink_img006.png)

Then you expand this polynomial out and look at it modulo $2$.
You get 
$$ I_{P_3,n} \equiv N_{P_3,n} \mod 2.$$ 
So this is rather suprising.
There are a lot of scary looking terms that drop out when you
take the mod.

$N_{P_3, n}$ is the polynomial for not-necessarily induced
$P_3$'s.

> note to self: section 6 looks particularly relevant. sections
3,4 seem to be prerequisite to understanding any of this stuff.
