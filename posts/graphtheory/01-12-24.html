<p>Note: in this blog post put a big-O around every statement that you see, even if there is already a big-O (in that case, it could be constructive to make the O even bigger, or put a tilde on it).</p>
<p>Typing some proofs from the paper Turan problems Even Cycles in hopes of better understanding them</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(ex(n, C_4, C_{2k}) = \Theta((kn)^2).\)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Call a pair of vertices FAT if they have <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> common neighbors. Call a <span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span> FAT if both pairs of opposite vertices are FAT.</p>
<p>observation: <span class="math inline">\(O((kn)^{2})\)</span> FAT <span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span>’s.</p>
<p>Now will show that there are very few non-fat <span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span>’s: <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{1+1/k})\)</span> only!</p>
<p>Itterate over the fat C4s in an arbitrary order. Each fat C4 marks whichever of its edges has been marked the fewest number of times so far. In the end we get some numbers <span class="math inline">\(m(e)\)</span> which is how many times each edge has been marked. Clearly <span class="math display">\[\sum_e m(e)\]</span> is the number of C4’s.</p>
<p>We claim that each <span class="math inline">\(m(e)\)</span> must be smaller than <span class="math inline">\(k^{4}2^{k}\)</span> or else we can find a <span class="math inline">\(C_{2k}\)</span>. We argue by contradiction.</p>
<p>Actually we will prove this in the following lemma:</p>
</div>
We show how to turn a <span class="math inline">\(C_{2\ell}\)</span> with a heavily marked edge into a <span class="math inline">\(C_{2(\ell+1)}\)</span> also with a heavily marked edge:
<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> For each <span class="math inline">\(\ell \in [2,k]\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> contains a <span class="math inline">\(2\ell\)</span>-cycle <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and there is an edge <span class="math inline">\(e_\ell\in C\)</span> with <span class="math display">\[m(e_\ell) \ge 2(k-1)k^2\binom{2k}{k}.\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We argue by induction. The base case is true by assumption. Now we assume that we have a <span class="math inline">\(2\ell\)</span>-cycle and a heavily marked edge, and show how to construct a <span class="math inline">\(2(\ell+1)\)</span>-cycle with a (slightly less) heavily marked edge.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> be the last <span class="math inline">\(2k^2\binom{2k}{k}-1\)</span> fat <span class="math inline">\(C_{2k}\)</span>’s to mark <span class="math inline">\(e_\ell\)</span>. In order for the cycles in <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> to mark <span class="math inline">\(e_\ell\)</span> when <span class="math inline">\(e_\ell\)</span> already has such a high weight it must be the case that all of their edges are pretty heavy as well. In particular they have weight at least <span class="math inline">\(2(k-\ell-1)k^2\binom{2k}{k}\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, the edges in <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> are great. If we can somehow replace <span class="math inline">\(e_\ell\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> edges from a cycle in <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> to produce a longer cycle then we would be cooking. This isn’t quite going to be possible but its the right flavor idea.</p>
<p>So it remains to show that there is some cycle in <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> that we can glue nicely to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>First, we need to eliminate cycles in <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> with all four vertices in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. This is not so bad: all cycles in <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> of course contain <span class="math inline">\(e_\ell\)</span>. Hence, there are at most <span class="math inline">\(\binom{2\ell-2}{2} \ll |F_\ell|\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(\ll\)</span> here just means, we can afford to charge more stuff to <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> beyond these cycles) <span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span>’s in <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> that are fully contained in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, if we had a <span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> with two vertices outside of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> then we would be chilling: <img src="src/images/ink_img001.png" alt="ink_img001" /></p>
<p>So, the only remaining case to consider is <span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span>’s in <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> that have one vertex in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> and one vertex outside of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>We’ll call one of these C4’s <strong>good</strong> if the outside of C vertex in it has fewer than <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> connections to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. We call such a C4 <strong>bad</strong> if its outside of C vertex has at least <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> neighbors in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. (Note that this is only an issue for the latter half of the recursion once the cycle gets rather long).</p>
<p>Now we use the fact that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(K_{k,k}\)</span>-free to argue that there aren’t too many bad C4’s. First, consider how many vertices can have more than <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> neighbors to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>: we see that it is at most <span class="math inline">\((k-1)\binom{2\ell}{k}\)</span> by virtue of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> being <span class="math inline">\(K_{k,k}\)</span>-free using the pidgeon hole principle. Thus, there are at most <span class="math inline">\((2\ell-2)(k-1)\binom{2\ell}{k}\)</span> bad C4’s.</p>
<p>Adding together the number of bad C4’s in <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> and the number of C4s from <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> that are completely contained in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> we find that <span class="math inline">\(|F_\ell|\)</span> is large enough that there is at least <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> good C4 (or else there is a C4 in <span class="math inline">\(F_\ell\)</span> that has two vertices outside of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, which we already noticed was good).</p>
<p>Now we show that a good C4 can help us find a larger cycle with a heavy edge. <span class="math inline">\(y,v\)</span> are a fat pair, so they have <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> common neighbors. But <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> doesn’t have <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> neighbors in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(y,v\)</span> have a common neighbor <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> outside of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. And that lets us find the desired longer cycle. <img src="src/images/ink_img002.png" alt="ink_img002" /></p>

<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(ex(n, C_{6}, C_{2k}) \le O((kn)^{3})\)</span></p>
<p>This proof generalizes relatively easily to <span class="math inline">\(ex(n, C_{2\ell}, C_{2k}) \le O((2kn)^{\ell})\)</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> standard lemma: <span class="math inline">\(\# P_2\)</span>’s out of any vertex is <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span>. proof: look at 2 step BFS.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(g(v_1,v_2,v_3)\)</span> denote the number of C6’s with <span class="math inline">\(v_i\)</span> as the <span class="math inline">\(2i\)</span>-th node for each <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(f(u,v)\)</span> denote the number of common neighbors of <span class="math inline">\(u,v\)</span> (i.e., uv 2-paths).</p>
<p>We have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g(v_1,v_2,v_3)\le f(v_1,v_2)f(v_2,v_3)f(v_3,v_1).\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\# C_6 \le \sum_{v_1,v_2,v_3} g(v_1,v_2,v_3) \le \sum_{v_1,v_2,v_3} \left(f(v_1,v_2)^2 + f(v_2,v_3)^2\right) f(v_3,v_1)\]</span> And as yufei would say, the “non-naive” bound above (pulling out the first terms) is vg.</p>
<p>Anyways we get <span class="math display">\[C_6 \le \sum_{v_1,v_2,v_3} \left(f(v_1,v_2)^2 + f(v_2,v_3)^2\right) f(v_3,v_1) \le \sum_{u\neq v} f(u,v)^2 \sum_{w} \left(f(w, v_1)  + f(w,v_2)\right)  \le 2n\sum_{u\neq v} f(u,v)^2\]</span> In this last inequality we used the fact that there are at most <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> P2s coming out of each vertex.</p>
<p>Now, we can bound hte <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{u\neq v} f(u,v)^{2}\)</span> thing because this is just the number of <span class="math inline">\(C_4\)</span>’s. See the previous theorem in this blog post for a proof of the C4 statement.</p>
<p>So we get <span class="math inline">\(\# C_6\le O((kn)^{3}).\)</span></p>
