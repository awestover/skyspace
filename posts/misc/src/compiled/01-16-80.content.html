<p>I will keep a running log of phi-club happenings and future plans here. Please post comments about any things that I’m missing or any ideas for future agenda items!</p>

<p>Also sorry comments deleted because I had to change the date.</p>
<p>Today we talked about some stuff Alek read in the Parameterized Complexity book, specifically about “kernelization”.</p>
<p>Then we solved the following problem which is not actually related to FPT stuff, but was in the textbook because it was talking about Konig’s theorem / matching stuff:</p>
<p>You partition space into <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> equal-area school-districts and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> equal-area military-districts. You want to build <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> pizza shops such that there is one pizza shop in every school-district and also in every military-district. Is it possible? Turns out the answer is yes. You can think of the problem as having a <span class="math inline">\(2n\)</span>-vertex weighted-bipartite graph, with the vertices corresponding to the school-districts and military-districts. The weight is how much the districts overlap.</p>
<p>Then, you can ask the question, what is the minimum vertex cover for this graph? And, the answer is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Because you cover at most <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>-unit worth of military area per each selected school district.</p>
<p>But then by LP duality or something this means that there is a matching in this graph of size <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. And that matching corresponds to where you should put the pizza shops.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>chicken nuggets</p></li>
<li><p>quasipoly algorithm for something</p></li>
<li><p>which random graphs are bipartite?</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p=\frac{\Theta(1)}{n}\)</span> threshold</li>
<li>TODO: whats the constant dependence</li>
<li>turns out that <span class="math inline">\(p=\Theta(\frac{1}{n})\)</span> is probably also planar threshold. we were mis-remembering what an induced minor is. seems rather important.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>we thought about chromatic number of random graphs</p></li>
<li><p>no ideas for <span class="math inline">\(\chi&gt;2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>except, some bounds: e.g., if you have a <span class="math inline">\(K_4\)</span> then your chromatic number is at least <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>possible conjecture: maybe there’s just a point where you get a really high chromatic number instantly.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nov-7">Nov 7:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Do PRGs exist? vs 1 bit adversaries?</p></li>
<li><p>we analyzed the case without a clock.</p></li>
<li><p>there are a very finite number of 2-state DFAs and also a very small number of functions on 2-state DFAs</p></li>
<li><p>if you don’t care about run-time buckets is a good idea</p></li>
<li><p>if you do care about run time then feeding like all 1s and then your random bits is maybe a good idea? it was a little bit subtle I don’t remember what ended up working</p></li>
<li><p>with a timer seems harder…</p></li>
</ul>
