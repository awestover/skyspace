<p>I hopefully am going to keep a running log of phi-club happenings and future plans here. Please post comments about any things that I’m missing or any ideas for future agenda items!</p>
<h3 id="future">Future</h3>
<ul>
<li>finish 2-factor theorem
<ul>
<li>Hall</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nov-14">Nov 14:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>chicken nuggets</p></li>
<li><p>quasipoly algorithm for something</p></li>
<li><p>which random graphs are bipartite?</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p=\frac{\Theta(1)}{n}\)</span> threshold</li>
<li>TODO: whats the constant dependence</li>
<li>turns out that <span class="math inline">\(p=\Theta(\frac{1}{n})\)</span> is probably also planar threshold. we were mis-remembering what an induced minor is. seems rather important.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>we thought about chromatic number of random graphs</p></li>
<li><p>no ideas for <span class="math inline">\(\chi&gt;2\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>except, some bounds: e.g., if you have a <span class="math inline">\(K_4\)</span> then your chromatic number is at least <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>possible conjecture: maybe there’s just a point where you get a really high chromatic number instantly.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nov-7">Nov 7:</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Do PRGs exist? vs 1 bit adversaries?</p></li>
<li><p>we analyzed the case without a clock.</p></li>
<li><p>there are a very finite number of 2-state DFAs and also a very small number of functions on 2-state DFAs</p></li>
<li><p>if you don’t care about run-time buckets is a good idea</p></li>
<li><p>if you do care about run time then feeding like all 1s and then your random bits is maybe a good idea? it was a little bit subtle I don’t remember what ended up working</p></li>
<li><p>with a timer seems harder…</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nov-1">Nov 1:</h3>
<ul>
<li>analyzed chopsticks a bit</li>
<li>proved that you can do quadratic residosity stuff in some special cases</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="oct-21">Oct 21:</h3>
<ul>
<li>thought about 2 factor theorem</li>
<li>maybe proved it for <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-regular graphs.</li>
<li>Konig’s theorem: in a bipartite graph, maximum matching size = minimum vertex cover size</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="oct-14">Oct 14:</h3>
<ul>
<li>bijection between 7-tuples of trees and trees</li>
<li>what other numbers work?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="oct-7">Oct 7:</h3>
<ul>
<li>union-find tried</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sept-30">Sept 30:</h3>
<ul>
<li>triangulation of a triangle, color vertices with 3 colors some color is banned on each of the edges. show that this is equivalent to Brower’s fixed point theorem which says that any function from ball to ball has a fixed point.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aug-10">Aug 10:</h3>
<ul>
<li>2-server on a circle</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="aug-1">Aug 1:</h3>
<ul>
<li>rational approximations for numbers</li>
</ul>
