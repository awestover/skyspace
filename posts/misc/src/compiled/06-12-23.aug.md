Lately, my favorite "fact", (I'm at least 95% true that I have a
correct proof of this statement, although have not writting it up
super carefully) is the following:

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
Let $x\in [\frac{p}{2}]$. Then there exist $m\le n$ and $k$ with  $|k| \le
\frac{p}{n}$ (where by $|k|$ I mean $\min(p-k, k)$) such that

$$x \equiv m^{-1}k \mod p.$$
</div>
What this means is, you can take any $x\in [p]$ and break it down
into two parts: a part of size in $[n]$ and a part of size in $[\frac{p}{n}]$.

I think this is super cool. 

PS: If it's not true, or if it is well known and you have a
citation for it, please let me know.

The proof sketch is as follows:
- for concreteness think of $x$ as being some size, like maybe $\approx \frac{p}{i}$ .
- So like after $i$ steps you wrap around once. And (assuming $x$ didn't already start super small), this wrap around thing will be pretty small, like less than $\frac{x}{2}$ say.
- keep going for a bit and you can get it down to $\frac{x}{3}$.
- You just do a bunch of balancing arguments to say that you're
    making progress.


Anyways, this blog isn't about a proof. It's just because I made
a cool picture of $x(m,k)$, see the heatmap above. Enjoy!


- **EDIT 1**: oops the picture literally proves that my above "theorem" is
somewhat false. well, sigh, happens.
- **EDIT 2**:  ok I modified the "theorem" to  say $x\in
[\frac{p}{2}]$ is uniquely represented by $m,k$. Now, this is not
in contradication with any observed data.
Still worth being cautious though.
- **Edit 3**: ok here's what is actually the case:

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
For each $x\in [p]$, there exists $m\le n, k\le \frac{p}{n},
\sigma \in \pm 1$ such that 
$$x \equiv \sigma m^{-1}k \mod p.$$
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
This is true by the pidgeon hole principle:

It you look at $[n]x$ it must have two poitns  $i,j$ with $xi,xj$
close. So then if we define  $k=|i-j|$ we have the desired
property.
</div>

So basically, above I was on the right track, but I got
side-tracked by trying to say that the representation was unique,
which doesn't make any sense and is also false.
