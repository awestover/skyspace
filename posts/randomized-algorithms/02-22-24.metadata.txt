Concentration Inequalities

Concentration inequalities are super useful. 
I write some down that I've heard lately so that they don't leak
out of my brain. Or rather, so that they leak more slowly and so
that hopefully by the time I realize I'm starting to forget I
have an easy reference. Or maybe they will be so frequently useful that
I won't have time to forget, unclear. Anyways, writing them down
will increase Pr I remember to use them.
