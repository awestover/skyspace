$$\Pr[X\ge m]\le \frac{G_X(a)}{a^m}$$ 
for any $a>1$ where $G_X$ is the generating function for the
probability distribution of $X.$ 

Similarly, 
$$\Pr[X\ge m] \le \Pr[a^X \ge a^m] \le \E[a^X]/a^m.$$


These are basically how you can get Chernoff bounds I guess.

# something else

For a non-negative ranvom variable $X$
$\E[X | Y] \le \E[X] / \Pr[Y]$
