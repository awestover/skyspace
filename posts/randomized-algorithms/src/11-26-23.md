Two choices:

$m$ balls and $n$ bins. 
Each ball is randomly and fully independently assigned two target
bins that it is allowed to be placed in. It chooses the less
crowded of the two. 

The **overload** is the fill of the fullest bin minus $\frac{m}{n}$.

beg thm
- Overload is $\bigO(\log m)$ whp in $m$ 
- Overload is $\bigO(\log\log n)$ whp in  $n$
end thm
beg pf

Actually this is basically a question that my friend Nathan told
me a [while ago](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/combinatorics/09-26-23.html).

Here's a really simple argument:
Imagine you're at overload $h$. 
We play the following casino game:

you keep placing balls until you either hit overload $2h$ or hit $0$, at
which time you lose.

Observe that the probability that it is like $3^{h}$ times more
likely that you will be at $0$ than at $2h$.

Now consider the following thought experiment:

You have a game that you win with probability $n^{-100}$.
You play the game $n$ times. What is the probability that you
win? Answer at most $n^{-99}$.

So in summary, this proves that overload is $\bigO(\log m)$.

As for the other result I'm not sure, but will think about it
sometime.
