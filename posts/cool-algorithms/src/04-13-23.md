LCA = RMQ
{contents}

{description}
LCA and RMQ are some pretty fundamental problems. Can we solve in
constant time with linear preprocessing? yes.

beg defn
Given a tree (not necessarily balanced) LCA(x,y) means the least
common ancestor. 
end defn

beg defn
Given an array RMQ(i,j) means the smallest element that occurs in
the array between indices $i$ and $j$.
end defn 

beg thm
Say we write down the nodes and depths of nodes as they occur in
a DFS traversal of a tree. then the shalowest node that we
encounter on the DFS between two vertices $x,y$ is their LCA.
end thm
beg pf yes
end pf

beg cor
Thus, LCA is reduced to RMQ. But actually a very special RMQ:
RMQ on an array where adjacent elements differ by $\pm 1$.
end cor

beg thm
we can solve RMQ pretty easily in $O(n\log n)$ prep, $O(1)$
query.
But $\pm 1$ RMQ we can do in $O(n)$ prep, $O(1)$ query.
by four russians.
end thm

beg thm
We can reduce general RMQ to LCA, by constructing a cartesian
tree thing in linear time.
end thm

beg defn
cartesian tree thing: 
root is min element. that splits the array into two parts, left
and right. then recursively construct those. 

note : if you build one node at a time you can build this in
linear time.
