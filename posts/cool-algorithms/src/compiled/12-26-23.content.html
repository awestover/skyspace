<p>One of the interesting results in “Deterministic Time-Space Tradeoffs for k-SUM” is</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> 3-SUM is in deterministic time <span class="math inline">\(\hat{O}(n^{2} / \log n)\)</span> and space <span class="math inline">\(\hat{O}(\sqrt{n} \log n)\)</span>.</p>
<p>(We use <span class="math inline">\(\hat{O}\)</span> to mask <span class="math inline">\(\mathop{\mathrm{\text{polylog}}}\log\)</span> factors.)</p>
</div>
Another interesting result that they prove is:
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> The following problem is equivalently hard to 3sum: Solve 3-SUM in subquadratic time with <span class="math inline">\(n^{1/2+\varepsilon}\)</span> space.</p>
<p>So either there is no subquadratic 3-SUM algorithm, or there is one with space requirement <span class="math inline">\(O(n^{.51})\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="rmk envbox">
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> It’s widely believed that <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-SUM requires <span class="math inline">\(n^{\left\lceil k/2 \right\rceil-o(1)}\)</span> time. It’s not known how to do polynomial method for <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-sum: the best improvement is just a polylog factor. For <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>-sum it is not even known how to eliminate a log factor.</p>
</div>
<p>Then they do some domination thing with posets that I really didn’t follow. If you are a reader and can explain this to me, please contact me! I get why they need it though: They do a self-reduction, sorting (well they don’t actually sort, because they can’t afford to in their space bound, but they just “implicitly sort” without writing down the sorted list) I originally (naively) thought that it was obvious that if you sorted and split into buckets each pair of buckets would interact with <span class="math inline">\(O(1)\)</span> other buckets. This would be true if, e.g., the buckets were sets with bounded doubling :). However, they do some fancy stuff to show this I guess. Or, I’m not even sure that it is true anymore, but they at least show that its true “on average”. I.e., the number of triples of buckets that interact is <span class="math inline">\(O((n/g)^{2})\)</span>.</p>
Here’s how they “implicitlt sort” because I thought it was neat:
<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> The <strong><span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-select problem</strong> is to find the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-th smallest item in a list.</p>
<p>The <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>-select problem can be solved in <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> time and <span class="math inline">\(O(s)\)</span> space.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> You keep a list of size <span class="math inline">\(2s\)</span>. You start by putting the first <span class="math inline">\(2s\)</span> elements in your list. Then you throw out the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> smallest by doing median select and filtering.</p>
<p>Then you absorb the next <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> elements and then throw out the <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> smallest elements from your new array. And so on.</p>
</div>
<p>Ok, now here’s a bit more about how their reduction works:</p>
<p>Recall, we have so far done the following: Sort the array and partition into chunks of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> contiguous elements. Now:</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Suppose we chose a random prime in <span class="math inline">\([mg^{7}]\)</span>. Then for any set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(3g\)</span> numbers in <span class="math inline">\(2^{m}\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> has a 3SUM solution then <span class="math inline">\(\Pr\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> has a 3SUM solution <span class="math inline">\(\bmod p\)</span> is 1.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> doesn’t have a 3SUM solution then <span class="math inline">\(\Pr\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> has a 3SUM solution <span class="math inline">\(\bmod p\)</span> is at most <span class="math inline">\(O(\log m + \log g)/g^{4}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>-bit numbers have at most <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> prime factors.</p>
</div>
We are going to set <span class="math inline">\(g = O(\log n / \log \log n)\)</span>.
<div class="rmk envbox">
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> For any prime <span class="math inline">\(p\le g^{O(1)}\)</span> there is a data structure of size <span class="math inline">\(g^{O(g)}\)</span> that can answer any 3SUM instance on <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> numbers modulo <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
</div>
Final algorithm:
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong></p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>Pick random prime <span class="math inline">\(p\le g^{O(1)}\)</span>. construct lookup table for all 3sum instances on <span class="math inline">\(3g\)</span> numbers mod <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</li>
<li>Compute numbers mod <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Probability that this creates a fake 3sum solution is less than <span class="math inline">\(1/g^{3}\)</span>.</li>
<li>Run 3sum self-reduction to get <span class="math inline">\(O((n/g)^{2})\)</span> 3sum instances on <span class="math inline">\(3g\)</span> numbers. Solve these by the look-up table.</li>
<li>If more than <span class="math inline">\(100 (n^2/g^{5})\)</span> of the subproblems said yes, report yes. there’s no way that we could have this many false positives (at least with constant probability by Markov)</li>
<li>Else, just itterate through all the reported solutions and check whether they are real solutions.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Oh, so actually this saves <span class="math inline">\(\log^{2}\)</span> factor if you are in unit-cost word-ram. And still <span class="math inline">\(\log\)</span> factor if not.</p>
