<p>The thing to wrap your head around in all of these algorithms is that vertices appear in a bunch of different places, but those places are “contiguous” and satisfy nice “separation” properties.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> In a general graph it is quite a difficult question.</p>
<p>However, suppose that your graph is a subgraph of a not-so-tall grid. In particular a grid of height <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. In this case we can also give a pretty nice DP.</p>
<p>We sweep over columns. Each column just needs to know which of the up to <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> vertices in the previous column were chosen. There are <span class="math inline">\(2^{k}\)</span> possibilities. So our DP table has an entry for each possibility.</p>

<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> In the DP each node in the tree computes, for all possible subsets of the nodes in its bag to include, what the best stuff is for its subtree.</p>
<p>To prove correctness we analyze the four types of nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>leaves (base case)</li>
<li>introduce</li>
<li>forget</li>
<li>join</li>
</ul>
<p>The separation property lets us get nice algorithms.</p>
<p>For instance, lets talk about introduce nodes: Let <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> be an introduce node with child <span class="math inline">\(X_{t&#39;}\)</span>, where the vertex introduced at <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span>. Fix a subset <span class="math inline">\(S\subset X_t\)</span>. First, check if <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is independent. If not, set <span class="math inline">\(c[t, S] = -\infty\)</span>. Else, split into two cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(v\notin S\)</span> then the answer is <span class="math inline">\(c[t&#39;,S]\)</span>. This is clear.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(v\in S\)</span> then the answer is <span class="math inline">\(c[t&#39;, S\setminus\{v\}] + w(v)\)</span>. It’s pretty clear you can’t hope to do better than this. Slightly less obvious why you can do this well. The reason is, if you let <span class="math inline">\(\hat{S&#39;}\)</span> be the best set for <span class="math inline">\(c[t&#39;, S\setminus\{v\}]\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> has no edges to <span class="math inline">\(\hat{S&#39;}\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> has no edges in <span class="math inline">\(\hat{S&#39;}\cap X_{t&#39;}\)</span> due to <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> being independent and <span class="math inline">\(S\setminus\{v\} = \hat{S&#39;}\cap X_{t&#39;}\)</span>. But also <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> has no edges in <span class="math inline">\(\hat{S&#39;}\setminus X_{t&#39;}\)</span> by the separation property. Anyways this means you can take <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</li>

<div class="defn envbox">
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> We slightly modify the nice tree decomposition definition to be <strong>extra nice</strong>: now we have “introduce edge bags”.</p>
<p>algorithm for turning a nice tree decomposition into an extra nice tree decomp: put the edge introduce bags between the highest node containing a vertex and the vertex forget bag that used to be that bag’s parent.</p>
<p>Now instead of just looking at <span class="math inline">\(G[V_t]\)</span> the induced subgraph on the bag subtree rooted at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, we look at <span class="math inline">\(G_t\)</span> which is like <span class="math inline">\(G[V_t]\)</span> except in only includes edges whose edge add bag are in the subtree rooted at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>

<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> dom set in graphs of bounded tree-width is FPT</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> instead of just having a 2 coloring of the vertices in each bag we now have a 3 coloring:</p>
<ul>
<li>black: must be included in partial solution</li>
<li>white: not contained in partial solution, and must be dominated by the partial solution</li>
<li>grey: not in partial solution. doesn’t matter whether they’re dominated by it or not.</li>
</ul>
<p>now we give the DP</p>
<ul>
<li>leaf node (base case): trivial</li>
<li>introduce vertex node: added vertex is isolated. so, if it’s black <span class="math inline">\(+1\)</span>, if its white <span class="math inline">\(+\infty\)</span>, if its grey <span class="math inline">\(+0\)</span>.</li>
<li>introduce edge node: adding an edge can allow you to relax stuff to grey</li>
<li>forget node: force that guy not to be grey</li>
<li>join node: if <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> black in both then black in join. grey iff grey in both. white else.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="steiner-tree">steiner tree</h2>
<p>connectivity. makes run-time slightly worse</p>
<p>so as part of the state with each node you store a partition of the vertices in the bag.</p>
<p>the partition basically corresponds to connected components of a forest that you’re building.</p>
