<p>Problems (from “Parameterized Algorithms” textbook):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> contain <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> vertex-disjoint triangles?</p>

<p>Does a graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> contain a subgraph isomorphic to a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-vertex tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>?</p>

<p><strong>At the moment this blog post is a bit of a failure</strong> because the bound claimed in the textbook is that we can give a <span class="math inline">\(2^{\mathcal{O}(k)}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\)</span> algorithm for both of these problems but my algorithms are more like <span class="math inline">\(k^{k}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\)</span> flavor. Hopefully I’ll fix this soon! If you have ideas lmk.</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> There is a <span class="math inline">\(k^{k}n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\)</span> algorithm for this problem.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Assume that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a yes-instance. <!-- We give an algorithm to find $k$ vertex-disjoint triangles in --> <!-- $G$ that succeeds with probability at least $2^{-\bigO(k)}$. --> <!-- By repeating this algorithm $2^{\Omega(k)}$ times we can get an --> <!-- algorithm that successfully finds $k$ such triangles with --> <!-- $\Omega(1)$ probability. --> <!-- In turn, if the algorithm fails to find these triangles then with --> <!-- probability $\Omega(1)$ $G$ is a no-instance.  --></p>
<!-- Identify a vertex within each triangle. Call the set of these -->
<!-- vertices $T$, with $|T|=k$. -->
<!-- Randomly partition the vertices of $G$ into two parts $A\sqcup B -->
<!-- = V(G)$. With probability $2^{-k}$ all of the vertices in $T$ are -->
<!-- in $A$; assume that this happens.  -->
<!-- Randomly color the vertices of $A$ with $k$ colors.  -->
<!-- With probability at least $k!/k^{k}  \approx e^{-k}$ the vertices of $T$ -->
<!-- recieve distinct colors; assume that this happens.  -->
<!-- Now we form a bipartite graph on vertices $L\sqcup R$.  -->
<!-- The vertices $L$ will be the edges in $G[B]$. -->
<!-- The vertices $R$ will be the color classes in our coloring of -->
<!-- $G[A]$. I.e., $|R|=k$ and each vertex of $R$ corresponds to the -->
<!-- set of all vertices of a single color in $G[A]$. -->
<!-- Place an edge between edge $e\in L$ and color class $C\in R$ if -->
<!-- there is any vertex $v\in C$ which is in the common neighborhood -->
<!-- of $e\in G[B]$. -->
<!-- Now, using flow or some optimized flow variant determine whether -->
<!-- there is a matching of size $k$ in the bipartite graph on -->
<!-- $L\sqcup R$. -->
<!-- **NO THIS DOESNT WORK I was allowing myself to repeat vertices** -->
<!-- **some other ideas** -->
<!-- we can partition into 3 parts.  -->
<!-- 3DM is pretty tricky but what about k 3DM? -->
<p><span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-color the vertices. Hope that your triangles get highlighted. They do with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{k^{2k}}\)</span>. If they get highlighted they’re easy to find.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(k!n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}\)</span> algorithm for iso tree</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Number the tree. Color the edges. Hope they got colored in the same way we numbered them. Do a DP: “can I make it so that this vertex is the right place to attach the next edge?”</p>
