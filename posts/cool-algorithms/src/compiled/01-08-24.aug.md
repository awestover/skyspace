# Simple Kernels

Vertex cover is covered (hahahaha) in a different blog post.

FAST: Feedback arc set in Tournaments

(find a set of edges "hitting" all the cycles)

<div class="lem envbox">**Lemma.**
A minimal (in the sense that if you delete any edge from the set
the property fails; not necessarily minimum) set of edges in the
whose reversal in the tournament results in a DAG is also a
minimal (in the same sense as above) feedback arc set.
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**

![proof](src/images/FASTFPT.jpg)

</div>

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
nice kernel for FAST
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**

- must take edges involved in more than $k+1$ triangles
- is safe to delete vertices not involved in any triangle
- at this point I think you get a bound of like $O(k^{2})$ on
    number of edges in a YES instance based on the two above reductions.

</div>

ECC: edge clique cover. 
cover edges by cliques.

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
$2^{k}$ sized kernel
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**

- it is safe to delete connected components which are already cliques (and decrease $k$ by one here).
- it is safe to merge "true twins": vertices with identical (closed) neighborhoods.

    At this point we claim that in any YES instance there are at
    most $2^{k}$ vertices left. 
    Assume for contradiction that we have a YES instance, i.e.,
    there are cliques $C_1,C_2,\ldots, C_k$ covering all the
    edges, but we have more than $2^{k}$ vertices. 

    Then associate a $k$-bit vector with each vertex indicating
    which of the $C_i$ clique's its part of.

    By pidgeon two vertices share an indicator vector. That means
    they are true twins, a contradiction.

</div>


A solved problem: can you delete k vertices to make a graph have
max-degree $d$?
Pretty similar rules to VC. 
One interesting one is, you have high-deg and low-deg vtxs. And
you can just toss vertices which aren't adjacnet to any high-deg
vertices. 


# LP-based kernels

A lot of NP-hard problems are easily phrased as ILPs.
ILP is hard. But often we can get a lot of info about what the
ILP solution should look like by relaxing to an LP.

Vertex cover LP relaxation:

$$\forall uv\in E, x_u + x_v \ge 1$$
$$\forall v\in V, x_v \in [0,1]$$
$$\min \sum_{v\in V} x_v.$$
We can think of this as a "fractional vertex cover".

<div class="lem envbox">**Lemma.**
Take an LP solution.
Let $V_0$ be vertices in the LP solution with $x_v< 1/2$
Let $V_{1/2}$ be vertices with $x_v=1/2$ and finally let $V_1$ be
vertices with $x_v>1/2$.

Then, it turns out that there is a minimal vertex cover $S$
satisfying:

$$V_1 \subseteq S \subseteq V_1\sqcup V_{1/2}.$$
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**

Take any minimum vertex cover $S^*$. 
Form $S$ by taking $S^{*}$ and removing the $V_0$'s and adding
any missing $V_1$'s.

Claim: $S$ is also a minimum VC.
proof: by contradiction.
Specifically, assume $S$ is a worse VC.
Turns out we can use this to show that the LP solution that
generated $V_0,V_{1/2},V_1$ was actually suboptimal.

</div>

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
Vertex Cover kernel
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
Run LP (actually you don't need to, you can do some kinda flow thing
instead of actually running LP; but same effect).

Toss $V_0$. Take $V_1$. Size of $V_{1/2}$ can't be too large or
we auto reject.
