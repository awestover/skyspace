for $d|n$, for  $x\in \set{0,1}^d$, make sure $x$ isn't $k$-periodic
for any $k|d, k< d$; this can be done in linearithmic time because it
suffices to check for  $p|d$ which is distinct prime divisors,
and each such check requires linear time.

Now, you might ask, what the running time is. It is of course 
$$\sum_{d|n} 2^d d\log d$$

Now, is this actually better than just generating all binary
strings of length $n$ and then for each pair, checking if they
are rotated copies of one another?
of course! that's like $\Omega(4^n)$. This should be more like
$O(2^n n^2)$ or something... 
(I haven't been able to do the sum yet, but whateves.)

**it has been noted that it is possible to do this much faster
and simpler with using hash tables; but can we beat** $O(2^n)$? i
kind of doubt it

Now you might ask, what if I want to also rule out reflectional
symmetry and rotoation + reflectional symmetry ?


you might also ask is it possible to  check rotational /
roto-reflectional symmetry faster than $n^2$ time?
