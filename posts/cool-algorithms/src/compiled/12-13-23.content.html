<p>I feel like I can never remember what min-cost circulation (MCC) is, or what the basic facts about it are. So here is a short blog post where I remind myself of what MCC is.</p>
<p><a href="https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.854/06/scribe/s12-minCostFlowAlg.pdf">Based on some scribed notes for Karger’s Advanced Algorithms course</a></p>
<div class="defn envbox">
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a graph, where each edge <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> has a capacity <span class="math inline">\(u(e)\ge 0\)</span> and a cost <span class="math inline">\(c(e)\in \mathbb{R}\)</span>. Identify source and sink vertices <span class="math inline">\(s,t\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>A min-cost max-flow is a flow on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> of minimum cost. That is, it is an assignment of values <span class="math inline">\(f(e) \in [0, u(e)]\)</span> subject to “conservation of flow” at all but the source and sink vertices, i.e., so that <span class="math inline">\(\sum_{u\to v}f(u\to v) - \sum_{w\to u} f(w\to u) = 0\)</span> for all vertices <span class="math inline">\(u\notin \left\{ s,t\right\}\)</span>, which minimizes <span class="math display">\[\sum_e f(e) c(e).\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="rmk envbox">
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> flow can be decomposed into paths and cycles.</p>
</div>
<div class="defn envbox">
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> <strong>Min-cost circulation</strong>: again you have a capacitated graph with edge costs. The only difference is that there is no source / sink. The goal is to choose a flow, called a circulation in this context that of course satisfies the capacities and conservation of flow, which makes the cost of the flow minimized.</p>
</div>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Algorithms for min-cost max-flow and algorithms for min-cost circulation are easily interchangable.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong></p>
<p>Given a min-cost circulation instance you can add a dummy source and sink vertex not connected to anything to obtain a min-cost max-flow instance.</p>
<p>Here are two ways to turn a min-cost max-flow instance into a min-cost circulation instance:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Add an edge <span class="math inline">\(t\to s\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> capacity and <span class="math inline">\(-\infty\)</span> cost.</li>
<li>Find an arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(s,t\)</span> max-flow, and then find a min-cost circulation in the residual graph.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> A circulation is a minimum-cost circulation iff the residual graph has no negative cycles.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> If residual graph has negative cycle you can augment to obtain lower cost.</p>
<p>If we have a sub-optimal circulation, then consider the difference between our sub-optimal circulation and an optimal circulation. It is a circulation with a negative-weight cycle.</p>
</div>
<p>So you could do Bellman Ford.</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Some super crazy algorithm can solve MCC in <span class="math inline">\(O(m^{1+o(1)})\)</span> ish.</p>
</div>
<div class="defn envbox">
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Price functions are maybe good for more elementary algorithms for computing the min-cost circulation.</p>
<p>A <strong>feasible price</strong> function is <span class="math inline">\(p: V\to \mathbb{R}\)</span> with</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(p(s) = 0\)</span>,</li>
<li>For each edge <span class="math inline">\(v\to w\)</span> we have <span class="math inline">\(p(w) \ge p(v)+c(v\to w)\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reduced cost</strong>: <span class="math inline">\(c(v\to w) +p(v)-p(w)\)</span>. It’s like you pay <span class="math inline">\(p(v)\)</span> dollars to pick up the item, and earn <span class="math inline">\(p(w)\)</span> for delivering it, and pay <span class="math inline">\(c(v\to w)\)</span> for travelling. If reduced cost is negative there is economic incentive to move flow around.</p>
<p>So, a price function is feasible for a residual graph if no residual edge has negative reduced cost.</p>
<p><strong>Observation:</strong> the min-cost circulation in the graph of reduced costs is the same as in the actual graph: because when you add the reduced costs in a cycle it is the same as if you add the real costs in a cycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Circulation is optimal iff feasible price function in residual graph.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> If feasible price function then no negative weights, and in particular no negative cost cycles in residual graph. Discussed earlier this is sufficient condition.</p>
<p>If circulation is minimum cost then we assign prices as follows: add a vertex <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> with cost <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> edges to all other vertices. Compute the prices as the distance from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. This graph has no negative cost cycles due to being optimal so the distances will all be finite. It is clear that distances satisfy the feasibility condition.</p>
