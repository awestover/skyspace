<p>I’m actually super hyped for this chapter, it looks so fancy, and has “fourier guys”. I also just realized that I really want to understand Fourier analysis. So I will probably take a class on fourier analysis instead of a complexity theory class. Hard choice.</p>
<p>Yeah, this chapter is low key my favorite!! I mean, color coding is still my favorite technique just because of how useful it is. But I really want to thoroughly understand this chapter because it is super cool.</p>
<h1 id="pie">PIE</h1>
<p>PIE says</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[|\bigcap_i A_i| = \sum_{X\subseteq [n]} (-1)^{|X|} |\bigcap_{j\in X} U\setminus A_j|.\]</span></p>
<p>Now, the whole “sum over <span class="math inline">\(2^{n}\)</span> subsets” approach might not seem good. But, let’s just do an application.</p>
<h2 id="num-ham-cycles">num ham cycles</h2>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Fix some vertex <span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> be the set of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> closed walks starting at <span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(A_v\)</span> be the set of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> closed walks starting at <span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span> that visit vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> at least once.</p>
<p>Then, the number of hamiltonian cycles in the graph is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left|\bigcap_v A_v \right|\]</span></p>
<p>But we can actually compute the terms on the RHS: <span class="math display">\[\bigcap_{v\in X} U\setminus A_v\]</span> is the number of closed walks of length <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> starting from <span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span> in the graph <span class="math inline">\(G-X\)</span>. We can compute this with MM.</p>
<p>So we get a <span class="math inline">\(2^{n}n^{O(1)}\)</span> time algo for computing number of HAM-cycles in a graph. Polynomial space, so that’s a plus.</p>
</div>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Ok now we are going to try to do Steiner Tree. In HAM cycle the key insight was that walks are easier to count than paths. Here we are going to do something similar: we are going to count “branching walks” instead of trees.</p>
<p>Branching walks are ordered homomorphic trees. Basically, you give me a tree with some numbers on it (subject to the stipulation that numbers on children have to be larger than numbers on their parents). And then I need to map it’s vertices to the graph. But I’m allowed to do homomorphic stuff.</p>
<p>So we run PIE again, and get the problem of counting the number of branching walks in certain graphs.</p>
<p>This can be computed with a clever DP:</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(b_j(a)\)</span> denote the number of length <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> branching walks starting from <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. As the base case we have <span class="math inline">\(b_0(a) = 1\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(j&gt;0\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[b_j(a) = \sum_{t\in N_G(a)} \sum_{j_1+j_2 = j-1} b_{j_1}(a)
b_{j_2}(t).\]</span> The neat thing here is that we just peal off a bit of stuff from the branching walk and recurse-anate the rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Chromatic Number</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(k\in O(1)\)</span>. Note that a proper <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-coloring of <span class="math inline">\(V(G)\)</span> can be thought of as a cover of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> independent sets.</p>
<p>To start we compute the numbers of independent subsets of each vertex set via dynamic programming in <span class="math inline">\(2^{n}n^{O(1)}\)</span> time. Let <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> be the set of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-tuples of independent sets.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A_v\)</span> be the set of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-tuples of independent sets <span class="math inline">\(I_1,\ldots, I_k\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(v\in \bigcup_i I_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then for any <span class="math inline">\(X\subseteq V\)</span> the quantity <span class="math inline">\(\bigcap_{v\in X} A_v\)</span> is the number of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-tuples of independent sets in <span class="math inline">\(G-X\)</span>. We can compute this easily: it’s the number of independent sets in <span class="math inline">\(G-X\)</span> raised to the <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-th power.</p>
<p>Then we PIE and win.</p>
<p>If you wanna do this in poly space the only solutions ppl know require <span class="math inline">\((2+\Omega(1))^{n}\)</span> time. A <span class="math inline">\(3^{n}n^{O(1)}\)</span> solution is to compute the number of independent subsets on the fly rather than storing all of them.</p>

<p>Observe:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\zeta(f\star g) = (\zeta f) \cdot (\zeta g).\]</span></p>
<p>This, combined with the inversion formula let’s us compute cover product fast.</p>
<p>Then, we can decompose <span class="math inline">\(f*g\)</span> into a small number of cover products.</p>
<p>let’s see an application first, because it’s hard to see where we’re going.</p>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Counting colorings via fast subset convolution:</p>
<p>Define <span class="math inline">\(s(X): \mathcal{P}(V)\to \left\{ 0,1\right\}\)</span> to be <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> iff <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is an independent set. Then</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(s*s*\cdots * s)(X)\]</span> i.e., <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> convolved with itself <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> times is the number of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-colorings of <span class="math inline">\(G[X]\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="rmk envbox">
<p><strong>Remark.</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes you might care about something like <span class="math display">\[\min_{A\cup B = Y, A\perp B} f(A)+g(B)\]</span> or <span class="math display">\[\min_{A\cup B = Y} f(A)+g(B).\]</span></p>
<p>You can interpret these as subset convolutions / cover products over min-sum semiring.</p>
<p>Then you could well ask, can we compute this stuff fast? Of course the mobius transform is not at all defined over these wacky semirings becuase they have no notion of <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>. But if the numbers are small you can embed them and then do fast stuff. Like you literally write them as bit vectors or whatever.</p>
</div>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> why you might care:</p>
<p>Suppose you wanted to compute the min-cost coloring of a graph. So, there is a function <span class="math inline">\(c(v,i)\)</span> which says “coloring <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> color <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> costs <span class="math inline">\(c(v,i)\)</span>”. You can express this as a convolution over a min-sum semiring.</p>
</div>
<h1 id="longest-path">longest path</h1>
<p>looks like they spend most of the tools that they develop working on longest path problem, to give an alternative to the color coding stuff.</p>
<p>anyways, I’ll read that tomorrow.</p>
<p>ok this is super off-topic but, I was trying to come up with an algorithm for longest path in graphs of bounded tree-width. One reason you might care about such a thing is that it’d imply a <span class="math inline">\(2^{\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})}\)</span> time algorithm for longest path in planar graphs.</p>
<p>I have a sketch of an idea, not totally sure if it works, writing it down here and hopefully can more carefully check at some point.</p>
<p>the idea is:</p>
<ul>
<li>state = store a partition of <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> into connected components of paths and also store how the stuff within each part is connected up.</li>
<li>specifically, for the partition and ordering etc you are storing the optimal length path-forest</li>
<li>forget vertex bag: take the stuff that used to be valid and push that vertex out of the bag, and then that is still valid.</li>
<li>add edge bag: try to splice the new edge in. Note that because <span class="math inline">\(X_t\)</span> is a separator it can’t connect down to stuff.</li>
<li>join bag: idk, maybe take a look at the steiner tree one in the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remark chapter 11 has a fancy “cut and count” technique that is supposed to be better for connectivity sensitive bounded treewidth DPs. Worth checking out at some point.</p>
<p>hmm, not very confident in this. Anyways, back to algebraic techniques.</p>
<h1 id="algebraic-longest-path">algebraic longest path</h1>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(S_k\)</span> denote the set of permutations of <span class="math inline">\([k]\)</span>.</p>
<p>We define monomials corresponding to labelled walks. We will have variables <span class="math inline">\(x_{uv}\)</span> for whether edges are included in the walk, and variables <span class="math inline">\(y_{v,i}\)</span> for whether vertex <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> got a label of <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> in the walk (note <span class="math inline">\(y_{v,i}, y_{v,j}\)</span> can both be true even if <span class="math inline">\(i\neq j\)</span>). Now for a fixed labelled walk <span class="math inline">\(W,\ell\)</span> we can test it’s existence with the following polynomial: <span class="math display">\[\text{mon}_{W,\ell}(x,y) = \prod x_{v_i, v_{i+1}} \prod y_{v_i, \ell(i)}.\]</span> Then, write the polynomial: <span class="math display">\[P(x,y) = \sum_{\text{walks } W=v_1,v_2,\ldots, v_k} \sum_{\ell \in S_k} \text{mon}_{W,\ell}(x,y).\]</span></p>
<p>Let’s say we are working over a field of characteristic <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, namely <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{F}_{2^{\left\lceil 8\log k \right\rceil}}\)</span>. Then we claim that the non-path walks in the above sum cancel out. So, <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is distinct from the zero polynomial (in this field) iff <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> has a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-path. Then we run polynomial identity testing. It’s kind of tricky to evaluate the polynomial, but turns out you can do it with weighted PIE and some DP stuff.</p>
<h1 id="faster-longest-path">faster longest path</h1>
<p>Next they describe some modifications to get better run time. But I think that’s enough for now.</p>
