<h1 id="lp-based-kernels">LP-based kernels</h1>
<p>A lot of NP-hard problems are easily phrased as ILPs. ILP is hard. But often we can get a lot of info about what the ILP solution should look like by relaxing to an LP.</p>
<p>Vertex cover LP relaxation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\forall uv\in E, x_u + x_v \ge 1\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\forall v\in V, x_v \in [0,1]\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\min \sum_{v\in V} x_v.\]</span> We can think of this as a “fractional vertex cover”.</p>
<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Take an LP solution.
