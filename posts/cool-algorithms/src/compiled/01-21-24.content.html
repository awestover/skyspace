<div class="defn envbox">
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> A matroid is a set of “edges” <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span> and “independent sets” <span class="math inline">\(F\subset\mathcal{P}(U)\)</span> (not in the graph theory sense in the LA sense) which I shall call <strong>isets</strong> with the following properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>empty set is an iset.</li>
<li>subset of an iset is an iset. (hereditary property)</li>
<li>If you have two isets with distinct sizes, then there is an element of the larger iset that you can add to the smaller iset and still get an iset. (exchange property)</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Basis: inclusion-wise maximal set of edges forming an iset</strong> <strong>Circuit: inclusion-wise minimal set of edges forming not forming an iset</strong>. <strong>Rank: size of bases.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> Uniform matroid: Fix <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span>. Every set of size at most <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> is an iset.</p>
</div>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> edges = set of vectors. isets = linearly independent sets of vectors</p>
<p>this is a matroid.</p>

<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Representation:</p>
<p>Some way of associating a matrix with a matroid.</p>
<p>vandermonde matrix = rep of uniform matroid</p>
</div>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> graphical matroids</p>
<p>matroid edges: edges in the graph isets: acyclic subgraphs.</p>
<p>It’s not obvious that this is a matroid. Hereditary property is obvious but not exchange. I thought the proof was kind of clever. The proof is as follows.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A,B \subseteq E(G)\)</span> be isets with <span class="math inline">\(|A|&lt; |B|\)</span>. Here’s how to run an exchange. <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> can’t have more edges than <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in any of the connected components of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Hence <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> has an edge going between two connected components of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. This is a safe edge to exchange.</p>
</div>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> representation of graphical matroids:</p>
<p>you direct the edges arbitrarily and then make a <span class="math inline">\(V\times E\)</span> matrix with a <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> in entry <span class="math inline">\(v,e\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> goes into / out of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</p>
<p>edit:</p>
<p>ok so it seems that the matrix representation needs to bring into correspondence isets and linearly indepdent combinations of vectors.</p>
<p>Like in the matrix you have a column <span class="math inline">\(v_e\)</span> for each edge <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. And you need the property that for any iset <span class="math inline">\(A\subset U\)</span> the set <span class="math inline">\(\{v_e \mid e\in A\}\)</span> is a linearly independent set of vectors.</p>
<p>Note that not all matroids are representable but nice ones are.</p>

<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Graphical Matroids admit a binary matrix representation</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong></p>
<p>You direct the edges arbitrarily and then make a <span class="math inline">\(V\times E\)</span> matrix with a <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1\)</span> in entry <span class="math inline">\(v,e\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> goes into / out of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</p>
<p>Claim 1: if you have a subset of edges containing a cycle then that corresponds to a set of linearly dependent vectors. standard thing: walk around the cycle.</p>
<p>Claim 2: If you have a set of edges which doesn’t contain a cycle then the vectors are linearly independent. Assume for contradiction that the vectors were linearly dependent. Take a non-trivial linear combination of them which makes zero. Then look at just the edges that have non-zero weight in this linear combination. One of those edges must be to a leaf node. But then that vertex doesn’t get non-zero weight in the sum, a contradiction.</p>
<p>rmk: generally we can work in F2 where <span class="math inline">\(+1=-1\)</span> so we just have vertex edge incidence matrix.</p>

<div class="defn envbox">
<p><strong>Definition.</strong> Transversal Matroids</p>
<p>Given a bipartite graph <span class="math inline">\(U\sqcup B\)</span> define the matroid as follows: universe is <span class="math inline">\(U\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(S\subseteq U\)</span> is an iset if there is a matching saturating <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>Again, it’s not obvious why this is a matroid. Apparently you can prove it with “flows”.</p>
</div>
<p>some problems are hard on matroids and some are not.</p>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>minimum / maximum weight basis: greedy algo works (b/c of exchange principle)</li>
<li>maximum circuit: NP-hard (HAM is a special case)</li>
<li>minimum circuit: “even set”: given a collection of subsets <span class="math inline">\(X_i\)</span> of a universe, find the smallest number of items <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> you can take so that <span class="math inline">\(|S\cap X_i|\)</span> is even for all <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> NP-hard</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently there are a bunch of hard open problems about whether certain matroid computations can be done in FPT. They mention some stuff that is known to be W1-hard, and some open stuff.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>-Matroid intersection problem: Given <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> matroids over the same universe and a value <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, determine whether there is a set <span class="math inline">\(S\subseteq U\)</span> of size at least <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> which is independent in all the given matroids.</p>
<p>Turns out the intersection of two Matroids is not generally a Matroid, or else this would be an easy question.</p>
<p>In fact, 3-Matroid intersection is NP-complete.</p>
<p>2-Matroid intersection is in P.</p>
<p>More generally, Matroid Parity is in P.</p>
