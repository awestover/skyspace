<p>Color coding has recently become my favorite technique in graph theory! This blog post doesn’t really do it justice. But it’s at least some notes.</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Feedback vertex set (find a set of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> vertices whose deletion renders your multigraph acyclic) is in FPT.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Reduction rules:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Delete vertices involved in loops</li>
<li>Reduce multi-edges to be at most 2-multiplicity</li>
<li>Delete connected components which are trees</li>
<li>If you have a degree-2 vertex you can “contract”: remove the vertex and join its neighbors. This is safe because it doesn’t affect the topology of your graph.</li>
</ol>
<p>In particular these reduction rules should guarantee that our graph has min-degree <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> after applying the reductions.</p>
<p>Now I think we have the following property: Let <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> be a set of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> vertices whose removal renders the graph acyclic. Then <span class="math inline">\(1/2\)</span> of the edges in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> have an endpoint in <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>.</p>
<p>Proof: I didn’t fully follow the proof. I think the gist is that once you remove <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> you gotta have a forest which has very few edges. And the min-degree condition is somehow just really good.</p>
<p>FPT algo: So based on the key lemma we get the following FPT algo for this problem</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Longest Path in FPT</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> The cannonical example of color coding! Color, hope its rainbow, and then DP.</p>
<p>There’s also a fancier <strong>divide and color</strong> algorithm. The idea is you try to partition the vertex set. But you try a bunch of different partitions. You have really high branching at low depth in the recursion tree and then really low branching at high depth. Somehow this improves the constant of the standard color coding algo a tiny bit.</p>

<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Subgraph isomorphism in graphs of bounded degree.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Color edges, hope that your stuff shows up as connected components. Bounded degree condition makes it relatively likely that you get separated out.</p>
<p>It’s slightly more complicated if your pattern graph isn’t connected. Then you do matching at the end.</p>
</div>
<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> If you randomly color a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-edge graph with <span class="math inline">\(q=100\sqrt{k}\)</span> colors then with probability at least <span class="math inline">\(2^{-\sqrt{k}}\)</span> you get a proper coloring</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(v_1,v_2,v_3,\ldots,\)</span> be vertices that arise from the following process:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>repeatedly delete a min-degree vertex</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They argue that <span class="math inline">\(v_i \le O(\sqrt{k})\)</span>. Seems pretty believable.</p>
<p>An inequality that comes up fairly often is <span class="math inline">\(1-x \le e^{-x}\)</span>. Here they use another interesting one though: if <span class="math inline">\(x\in(0,1/2)\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(1-x \ge 2^{-2x}\)</span>. Neat.</p>
<p>They think of the random coloring as happening one vertex at a time. Then, they probability of the <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th vertex getting a good color is at least <span class="math display">\[1-d_i / q \ge 2^{-2d_i/q}\]</span> using our bound on <span class="math inline">\(d_i\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, the total probability of success is at least:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2^{-2(1/q) \sum d_i} = 2^{-\sqrt{k}}.\]</span></p>
<p>It was pointed out that this is basically just a fancy way of saying that cliques maximize chromatic number per a given number of edges. But its a lot more quantitative than just saying that.</p>

<div class="rmk envbox">
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> This is cool. <span class="math inline">\(2^{o(k)}\)</span> is rare for FPT algos.</p>

<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-clustering chromatic coloring / color and conquer.</p>
<p>We say that a graph is a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-cluster graph if it consists of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> connected components, each of which is a clique. Problem: is there a set of <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> edges you can modify (add or delete) to make input graph be a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span>-cluster graph.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong></p>
<p>Assume yes instance. Let <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> be the set of edges we need to modify. So we apply the lemma in hopes that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is properly colored.</p>
<p>Assume that we have a coloring of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that is a proper coloring of a solution <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. The key observation is that <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> isn’t allowed to change any connections between vertices of the same color class. Hence, the induced subgraph on each color-class must already be <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span>-cluster graphs.</p>
<p>So now we have at most <span class="math inline">\(qd\)</span> parts. And we try all <span class="math inline">\(d^{qd}\)</span> ways of combining these into <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> clusters.</p>
<p>After guessing the combo we just count how many edges are missing within each of the clusters and how many bad edges go between clusters. If deleting them is within budget we do it and win. Else we keep going.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(k\le \ell\)</span>. You can define splitters for <span class="math inline">\(k&gt;\ell\)</span> as well but I don’t think it’ll be necessary for us. An <span class="math inline">\((n,k,\ell)\)</span>-splitter is a collection <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{F}\)</span> of colorings <span class="math inline">\(f: [n]\to [\ell]\)</span>, with the property that for any <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-element subset <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\([n]\)</span> there is some coloring <span class="math inline">\(f\in\mathcal{F}\)</span> that is injective onto <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, i.e., colors each element of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> a different color.</p>

<p><strong>Remark.</strong> The construction of this object is by composing a <span class="math inline">\((k^2,k,k)\)</span>-splitter (which is apparently easier to construct than an <span class="math inline">\((n,k)\)</span>-perfect hash family) and an <span class="math inline">\((n,k,k^2)\)</span>-splitter.</p>
<p>My attempt to construct a <span class="math inline">\((k^2,k)\)</span>-perfect hash family: there are only <span class="math inline">\(\binom{k^2}{k}\le k^{k}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-element subsets of <span class="math inline">\([k^{2}]\)</span>. So, we could itterate over these sets <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and for each of these define a coloring for the sole purpose of having the coloring be rainbow on <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. It seems they maybe have slightly better quantitative bounds, but this seems like the right vibe.</p>

<p>Here’s the lemma spelled out in a bit more detail:</p>
<p>Take a 2-wise independent sample space of functions <span class="math inline">\(f:[k^2]\to [\sqrt{k}]\)</span>. If you randomly sample a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> from the 2-wise independent sample space and use <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to color the at-most <span class="math inline">\(k^2\)</span> vertices of a <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>-edge graph, then in expectation <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{k}\)</span> of the edges will be monochromatic. Then we use alterations to fix those edges. Alterations basically means that we itterate over all possible things that these vertices could be and give them unique colors.</p>
