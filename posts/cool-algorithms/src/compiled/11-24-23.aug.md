Problems (from "Parameterized Algorithms" textbook): 

> Does a graph $G$ contain $k$ vertex-disjoint triangles?

> Does a graph $G$ contain a subgraph isomorphic to a $k$-vertex
tree $T$?

In fact, these are both special cases of a more general result:
there is (I'm pretty sure) a $2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ algorithm for
detecting whether any $k$-vertex pattern graph of treewidth $100$
(or whatever your favorite constant is, just be warned that the
constant is gonna make its way into the big-O, because subgraph
isomorphism for clique is probably W1-hard.) occurs as a subgraph
of your graph. Maybe I'll try to think about how to do that in a
moment.


<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
$2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ algorithm for triangle packing.
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
Color code with $3k$ colors. Hope that each of the $3k$ vertices
we need for our triangles got a distinct color, this happens with
probability at least $2^{-O(k)}$.

Now we do dynamic programming.
For any subset $C\subseteq [3k]$ of size a multiple of $3$ define
Let $S[C]$ to be the boolean indicating whether there are $|C|/3$
vertex disjoint triangles that can be made by using each color
from  $C$ exactly once.

Then we can recursively compute $S[C]$ as follows:
```python
for c1,c2,c3 in C:
  if there is a c1,c2,c3 triangle and S[C - c1c2c3]:
    YES
  else:
    NO
```

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
$2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ algorithm for subgraph isomorphism with
a tree pattern graph.
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
Color code.

Root the pattern tree, and for each vertex decide on a precednece
order for its children. 
There is a certain class of subtrees, indexed by edges, that will
be important for us.
Namely, the subtree associated with the $i$-th edge we call $S_i$
and it is defined as follows:
let edge $i$ have vertex $u$ closer to the root and vertex $v$
farther from the root. 
So in $S_i$ we take  $u$,  $T_v$ (the tree rooted at vertex $v$), 
and then also $w, T_w$ for any children $w$ of $u$ which are higher
precedence than $v$.

Now we define the dynamic program. 
For each vertex $v\in V(G)$, each edge $i$ in the pattern graph
and each color subset $C\subseteq [k]$ we will compute
$D[v, i, C]$ which is the boolean 
"Can we find a copy of $T_i$ in $G$ where the root of $T_i$ is
placed at vertex $v$ and we use precisely the colors $C$ for the
edges of this copy of $T_i$?"

Now we show how to compute $D$ recursively. 
For edges $i$ corresponding to edges to low-precedence leaves in
the tree its easy to fill in the DP: these guys are fine if $v$
has a color from $C$ and $v$ has a neighbor of the other color.

There are two cases in the induction:

- sibling
- child

Child is very easy: just itterate over neighbors of $v$ and check
if any of them can do the subtree we need.

Sibling is as follows:
itterate over partitions of the colors that you're allowed to
use.
Check for the "$T_{i-1}$" i.e., it's left sibling and also for
the subtree thing that you need.
