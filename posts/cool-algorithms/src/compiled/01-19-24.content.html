<p>A nice way to think about the “separation lemma” that is used in the treewidth approximation FPT scheme (credit to Tomas for pointint this out):</p>
<div class="clm envbox">
<p><strong>Claim.</strong> Suppose you choose any set of <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span> red vertices. Then there should be a bag of the tree-decomposition that you can take such that there at most <span class="math inline">\(R/2\)</span> red vertices in all the connected components left after the removal of that bag.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Direct the edges in the tree from “bag with fewer red vertices” to “bag with more red vertices” (arbitrarily break ties).</p>
<p>Then find a sink bag. This sink bag is the bag you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="rmk envbox">
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> Something I was confused about in the tree decomposition algorithm:</p>
<p>Once we pick the set that we are going to separate and then turn into a bag we <strong>itterate over all partitions of that set into three parts</strong> and run min-cut between each possible tripple of ways the set could get split.</p>
<p>By the lemma above there has to be a good way (or else we have a proof of large treewidth). We take that good partition.</p>
<p>Then let’s call the partition <span class="math inline">\(S\setminus B, (S\cap (A\cap B)) \cup X, S\setminus A\)</span>.</p>
<p>To recurse we then recurse on <span class="math inline">\(S\setminus B, (S\cap (A\cap B)) \cup X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S\setminus A, (S\cap (A\cap B)) \cup X\)</span>. The idea is, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> interfaces only with <span class="math inline">\(S\setminus B, (S\cap (A\cap B)) \cup X\)</span>, and similar for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. So this is what we want.</p>

<p>win/win framework.</p>
<p>Powerful theorem: large tree width implies you must have a large grid as a minor.</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a planar graph with treewidth <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> contains an <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(t)\times \Omega(t)\)</span> grid as a minor!</p>
</div>
<p>Sometimes <em>minor</em> is a bit annoying to work with. Relation notion: “graph achievable by edge contractions.”</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a planar graph with treewidth <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Then there is a sequence of edge contractions on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> that results in “<span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_t\)</span>”, which is a grid, and then you triangulate it, and then you have one corner vertex that is connected to all the boundary vertices.</p>

<h1 id="a-very-simple-example-of-using-treewidth">a very simple example of using treewidth</h1>
<div class="ex envbox">
<p><strong>Example.</strong> 3-coloring is FPT when parameterized by treewidth. Run time is <span class="math inline">\(O(3^{k}\cdot k\cdot n)\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong></p>
<p>We use the “add edge bag” framework.</p>
<p>Our DP is as follows: For each node <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in the tree decomposition and each 3-coloring <span class="math inline">\(f: X_t\to [3]\)</span> of the bag at <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> let <span class="math inline">\(D[t, f]\)</span> denote “is there an extension of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f&#39;:G_t\to [3]\)</span> that is a valid 3-coloring of <span class="math inline">\(G_t\)</span>?”</p>
<p>Now we recurse stuff as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>leaf bags: let <span class="math inline">\(f: \varnothing \to [3]\)</span> is the “empty function” (color zero vertices). This is our only option for a coloring. We say <span class="math inline">\(D[t, f] = \top\)</span>. (yes I have started using <span class="math inline">\(\bot,  \top\)</span> for T/F because latex has pretty good support for them and because <span class="math inline">\(\bot\)</span> kinda looks like <span class="math inline">\(\perp\)</span>, which is my favorite binary relation).</li>
<li>add vertex bags: at this point the vertex is isolated, so its fine as long as the restriction of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to not color this vertex is fine</li>
<li>add edge bags: as long as you don’t add an edge between two vertices with the same color you’re chilling</li>
<li>forget vertex bags: try all the colors for the vertex that you’re forgetting. if any of them work then you’re good.</li>
<li>join bags: take the intersection of the colorings for both childs.</li>
</ul>
