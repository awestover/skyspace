# basic definitions for matroids 

beg defn
A matroid is a set of "edges" $U$ and "independent sets"
$F\subset\mathcal{P}(U)$ (not in the graph theory sense in the LA
sense) which I shall call **isets** with the following
properties:

1. empty set is an iset.
2. subset of an iset is an iset. (hereditary property)
3. If you have two isets with distinct sizes, then there is an
   element of the larger iset that you can add to the smaller
   iset and still get an iset. (exchange property)

**Basis: inclusion-wise maximal set of edges forming an iset** 
**Circuit: inclusion-wise minimal set of edges forming not
forming an iset**.
**Rank: size of bases.**

end defn

beg ex
Uniform matroid: 
Fix $r$.
Every set of size at most $r$ is an iset.

Partition matroid:
a disjoint sum of uniform matroids
end ex

beg ex
edges = set of vectors.
isets = linearly independent sets of vectors

this is a matroid.
end ex

beg defn
Representation: 

Some way of associating a matrix with a matroid.

vandermonde matrix = rep of uniform matroid

end defn

beg ex
graphical matroids

matroid edges: edges in the graph
isets: acyclic subgraphs.

It's not obvious that this is a matroid. 
Hereditary property is obvious but not exchange.
I thought the proof was
kind of clever. 
The proof is as follows.

Let $A,B \subseteq E(G)$ be isets with $|A|< |B|$.
Here's how to run an exchange.
$B$ can't have more edges than $A$ in any of the connected
components of $A$. Hence $B$ has an edge going between two
connected components of $A$. This is a safe edge to exchange.

end ex

beg ex
representation of graphical matroids:

you direct the edges arbitrarily and then make a $V\times E$ matrix
with a $\pm 1$ in entry  $v,e$ if $e$ goes into / out of $v$.


edit:

ok so it seems that the matrix representation needs to bring into
correspondence isets and linearly indepdent combinations of
vectors.

Like in the matrix you have a column $v_e$ for each edge $e$.
And you need the property that for any iset $A\subset U$ the set
$\{v_e \mid e\in A\}$ is a linearly independent set of vectors.

Note that not all matroids are representable but nice ones are.

end ex

beg lem
Graphical Matroids admit a binary matrix representation
end lem
beg pf

You direct the edges arbitrarily and then make a $V\times E$ matrix
with a $\pm 1$ in entry  $v,e$ if $e$ goes into / out of $v$.

Claim 1: 
if you have a subset of edges containing a cycle then that
corresponds to a set of linearly dependent vectors.
standard thing: walk around the cycle.

Claim 2: 
If you have a set of edges which doesn't contain a cycle then
the vectors are linearly independent. 
Assume for contradiction that the vectors were linearly
dependent. Take a non-trivial linear combination of them which
makes zero.
Then look at just the edges that have non-zero weight in this
linear combination. 
One of those edges must be to a leaf node.
But then that vertex doesn't get non-zero weight in the sum, a
contradiction.


rmk: 
generally we can work in F2 where $+1=-1$ so we just have vertex
edge incidence matrix.

end pf

beg defn
Transversal Matroids

Given a bipartite graph $U\sqcup B$ define the matroid as
follows:
universe is $U$.
$S\subseteq U$ is an iset if there is a matching saturating $S$.

Again, it's not obvious why this is a matroid.
Apparently you can prove it with "flows".

end defn

some problems are hard on matroids and some are not.

beg ex

- minimum / maximum weight basis: greedy algo works (b/c of exchange
    principle)
- maximum circuit: NP-hard (HAM is a special case)
- minimum circuit: "even set": given a collection of subsets $X_i$ of a universe, find the smallest number of items $S$ you can take so that $|S\cap X_i|$ is even for all $i$ NP-hard

Apparently there are a bunch of hard open problems about whether
certain matroid computations can be done in FPT.
They mention some stuff that is known to be W1-hard, and some
open stuff.

end ex

# some algorithsm  for matroid problems

$\ell$-Matroid intersection problem:
Given $\ell$ matroids over the same universe and a value $k$,
determine whether there is a set $S\subseteq U$ of size at least
$k$ which is independent in all the given matroids.

Turns out the intersection of two Matroids is not generally a
Matroid, or else this would be an easy question.

In fact, 3-Matroid intersection is NP-complete.

2-Matroid intersection is in P.

More generally, Matroid Parity is in P.

## FVS

Ok, so here's an interesting fact: 

beg thm
FVS is solvable in poly-time on graphs with max-degree $3$. 
end thm
Initially this might seem shocking: lots of problems (e.g.,
hamiltonicity) are hard in graphs wtih max-degree 3. 
However, I guess we are going to view the $3$ as a $2$ in
disguise and then throw matroid parity at it. 

beg pf
We apply a bunch of reductions / rules.

And get it down to the following form:

Have two independent sets $A,B$. Each vertex in  $B$ has exactly
$3$ neighbors into $A$. Your goal is to choose a subset
$S\subseteq A$ of size $k$ such that $G-S$ is acyclic (i.e., $S$
is an FVS).

You make a matroid by considering the graphical matroid of a
clique on $A$.

For each $u\in B$, with neighbors $x,y,z\in A$ you associate the
pair of "edges" $P_u = \{xy,yz\}$ (matroid edges not actual edges, $B$ is
an independent set).

For $X\subseteq B$ define  $Z_X = \bigcup_{u\in X} P_u$.
The hope is that $G[A\sqcup X]$ is acyclic iff $Z_X$ is an iset
in the matroid, and furthermore the pairs in $Z_X$ are disjoint.

One direction is fairly straightforward. 
If $Z_X$ is not an iset we find a cycle in  $G[A\sqcup X]$
easily.
If $Z_X$ has two non-disjoint pairs we also find a cycle in
$G[A\sqcup X]$ easily.

These are depicted below

![ink_img013](images/ink_img013.png)

The other direction is more involved. 
Assume $G[A\sqcup X]$ has a cycle. We use it to show that we
didn't solve the matroid parity problem.

Anyways this shows that solving matroid parity lets you solve
this problem.

# a fun game

For sets $A,B$ we use the notation $A\perp B$ to denote  $A\cap B
= \varnothing$.
For events $X,Y$ we use the notation  $X\perp Y$ to denote that
 $X,Y$ are disjoint events.
 If we're lucky, for integers $x,y$ we will use the notation
 $x\perp y$ to denote that $x,y$ are relatively prime.
 And maybe for vectors $x\perp y$ to denote orthogonal vectors.
 And maybe for vector spaces.
 Anyways, I am liable to use $\perp$ to mean literally anything
 that has the right vibes.

Here's a fun game:

> Alice is dealt a family of $p$-element sets $\mathcal{A}$. Bob is dealt a
$q$-element set $B$. Alice knows $q$ but not $B$.
They sit around in silence. Then bob reveals $B$. Alice wins if
she can reveal $A\in \mathcal{A}$ with  $A\perp B$.
Fun.

Ok, let's make it slightly more fun:
Alice has bad memory but can't stand losing. 
She wants to compute a q-representative subset of $\mathcal{A}$.
This set needs to satisfy:

- it's just as good for the game as $\mathcal{A}$ (i.e., for any
    set $B$ that she could win on before she can still win).
- it's as small as possible.

Turns out that by a really sweet combinatorial lemma, Alice can
find a "small" representative set (modulo your definition of
small).

Bolobas's lemma:

beg lem
Suppose you have $p$-element sets $A_1,\ldots, A_m$ and
$q$-element sets $B_1,\ldots, B_m$ with $A_i\perp B_j$ iff
$i=j$.
Then  $m\le \binom{p+q}{p}.$
end lem
beg pf
Randomly order the universe.
Let $X\le Y$ denote the event  $x\le y$ for all  $x\in X, y\in Y$
with respect to this ordering.
Let $E_i$ denote the event $A_i\le B_i$.
Observe that $E_i\perp E_j$ (disjoint events) (draw a picture).
Hence, 
$$m \le 1/\Pr[E_i].$$
But clearly $1/\Pr[E_i] = \binom{p+q}{p}$, so we win.
