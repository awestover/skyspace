Color coding algorithms for triangle packing and tree detection
{body}

Problems (from "Parameterized Algorithms" textbook): 

> Does a graph $G$ contain $k$ vertex-disjoint triangles?

> Does a graph $G$ contain a subgraph isomorphic to a $k$-vertex
tree $T$?

In fact, these are both special cases of a more general result: 
there is (I'm pretty sure) a $2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ algorithm for
detecting whether any pattern graph of bounded treewidth occurs
as a subgraph of your graph. Maybe I'll try to think about how to
do that in a moment.

$2^{O(k)}n^{O(1)}$ algorithm for triangle packing.
end thm

Color code with $3k$ colors. Hope that each of the $3k$ vertices
we need for our triangles got a distinct color, this happens with
probability at least $2^{-O(k)}$.

Now we do dynamic programming.
For any subset $C\subseteq [3k]$ of size a multiple of $3$ define
Let $S[C]$ to be the boolean indicating whether there are $|C|/3$
vertex disjoint triangles that can be made by using each color
from  $C$ exactly once.

Then we can recursively compute $S[C]$ as follows:
```python
for c1,c2,c3 in C:
  if there is a c1,c2,c3 triangle and S[C - c1c2c3]:
    YES
  else:
    NO
```
end pf

still can't figure out trees actually. rip.
