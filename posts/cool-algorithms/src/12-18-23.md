In which I write down as many types of MM that I can look up, in
hopes that they will help solve a **really** hard problem.

# vanilla
$$\sum_k A_{i,k} B_{k,j}$$

By definition can be done in $n^{\omega}$ 
I guess assuming that the matrix entries are $O(1)$ machine words.

# Boolean 

$$\bigvee_k (A_{i,k} \land B_{k,j})$$

Can be done in $n^{\omega}$ where $\omega\in (2,2.4)$.
conjectured to be no "combinatorial algo" (which should losely be
interpretted as "practical") with run time $n^{3-\eps}$.

# min-plus 

$$\min_k A_{i,k} + B_{k,j}$$

Can be done in time $O(Mn^{\omega})$ where $M$ is the maximum
absolute value of entry in the matrix. 

Interesting fact: this MM variant isn't even associative!
I think when defining MM variants you really should take nothing
for granted.

# equality-product 

$$|\setof{k}{A_{i,k} = B_{k,j}}|$$

beg thm 
Solvable in the same time as dominance-product, and vice-versa.
(at least up to log-factor).

First we show how to take $2$ dominance products and then do $O(n^{2})$ work to combine their output into the answer to the equality product. 
It's quite straightforward: Count the number of $k$ so that
$A[i,k]\le B[k,j]$ and also the number of  $k$ so that $A[i,k]\ge
B[k,j]$. Add these numbers and subtract $n$. This results in the
number of double-counted numbers which are precisely the equality
cases.

Now for the more difficult dirrection. 

We take a Dominance product instance and convert it into $O(\log
n)$ equality product instances, whose sum is the dominance
product. 

We consider the numbers to be integers in the range $[0,n^{O(1)}]$.
Let $L\le O(\log n)$ be the maximum number of bits in any of the
numbers. From now on we think of the numbers as all being $L$
bits, padding with zeros as necessary. 

For each $\ell \in [L]$, form matrix $A_\ell$ by taking the $\ell$ most-significant bits of each entry in $A$. 
Define $B_\ell$ as the $\ell$ most-significant bits of each entry
in $B$, except: if the $\ell$-th most-significant bit is a $1$
then replace the number with "$\bot$" (i.e., some symbol that
isn't allowed to match with any values in $A_\ell$). If the $\ell$-th
digit is a $0$ then replace this $0$ with a $1$.

It's evident that this is basically just an $L$-overhead compared
to the equality product. 
Why does it work though?

The idea is, if $A[i,k]\le B[k,j]$ then we will count a point
towards  $(A \star_\le B)[i,j]$. In particular, we will count
this point on the matrices $A_\ell, B_\ell$ for $\ell$ being the
index of the first bit on which $A[i,k], B[k,j]$ differ. 

The intended solution in Virginia's class pset2 is
different. But I'm pretty sure that what I did works too.

# dominance-product

$$|\setof{k}{A_{i,k}\le B_{k,j}}|$$

Solvable in the same time as equality-product

beg thm
Dominance product can be computed in $n^{(\omega+3)/2}$.
end thm

For $i,j\in [n]$ let $a_i$ denote the $i$-th column of  $A$ and let
$b_j$ denote the $j$-th row of $B$.

![ink_img008](images/ink_img008.png)

For each $j$, sort $a_j\sqcup b_j$.
Fix parameter $p = n^{(\omega-1)/2}\in [n^{.5}, n^{.7}]$.
Define buckets $S_{j,1},S_{j,2},\ldots, S_{j,2n/p}$ to be
contiguous chunks of $a_j\sqcup b_j$ with size $p$.

For each $i,j$ record $H_{i,j} = $ which $j$-bucket $A[i,j]$ was
placed in. 
Similarly, for each $j,k$ record $G_{j,k} = $  which $j$-bucket
 $B[j,k]$ was placed in.

 Now, for each $b\in [2n/p]$ form matrices $A_b, B_b$ where
 $A_b[i,j]$ is $1$ if $A[i,j]$ was placed in bucket  $S_{j, b}$, 
 and  $B_b[j,k]$ is  $1$ if $B[j,k]$ was placed in a bucket
 $S_{j,b'}$ for some $b'>b$.

 Then, the integer matrix product
 $(A_b B_b)[i,j]$ counts the number of $k$ such that $A[i,k]\le
 B[k,j]$ and  $A[i,k]$ is in bucket  $b$ and $B[k,j]$ is not in
 bucket $b$.

 Summing over all values of $b$ gives the number of $k$ so
 that both $A[i,k]\le B[k,j]$ and  $A[i,k], B[k,j]$ are in
 different $k$-buckets. 

 Finally, we brute force over all pairs of elements in each of
 the buckets. There are $O(n^{2}/p)$ buckets and $p^{2}$ pairs of
 elements in each bucket. 
 This makes for $O(n^{2}p)$ checks that we need to do here. 
 Like, the check that we are doing is for each pair we adjust
 whichever product involves the both of them appropriately. 

 Anyways, the running time of this thing is 
 $$(n/p)n^{\omega}+n^{2}p \le n^{(\omega+3)/2}.$$

# un-named

$$\min_k \setof{B_{k,j}}{A_{i,k}=1}.$$

# max-min

# $\min$-$\le$

$$\min_k \setof{B_{k,j}}{A_{i,k} \le B_{k,j}}.$$

beg thm 
Can be computed in $n^{(9+\omega)/4}<n^{3}$ time.
end thm
beg pf 
Its also by bucket and brute force, similar to the dominance
product one.

# "witness matrix"

Imagine you have a matrix product like $\min, \odot$ for some
nice operation $\odot$.
The witness matrix is 

$argmin_k A_{i,k}\odot B_{k,j}$

# rectangular MM

$\omega(1,2,1)$ denotes how long it takes to multiply $n \times n^{2}, n^{2}\times n$ matrices. 
It is known that $\omega(1,2,1)\le 3.3$.


# some silly facts

Sidon set: $a+b=c+d \implies \set{a,b}=\set{c,d}$.
The primes are a "multiplicative sidon set".
