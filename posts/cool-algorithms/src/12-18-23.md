In which I write down as many types of MM that I can look up, in
hopes that they will help solve a **really** hard problem.

# vanilla
$$\sum_k A_{i,k} B_{k,j}$$

By definition can be done in $n^{\omega}$ 
I guess assuming that the matrix entries are $O(1)$ machine words.

# Boolean 

$$\bigvee_k (A_{i,k} \land B_{k,j})$$

can be done in $n^{\omega}$
conjectured to be no "combinatorial algo" (which should losely be
interpretted as "practical") with run time $n^{3-\eps}$.

# min-plus 

$$\min_k A_{i,k} + B_{k,j}$$

Can be done in time $O(Mn^{\omega})$ where $M$ is the maximum
absolute value of entry in the matrix. 

[reference](https://people.csail.mit.edu/virgi/6.890/lecture4.pdf)

# equality-product 

$$|\setof{k}{A_{i,k} = B_{k,j}}|$$

can be done fast (reference: personal communication with Virginia)

# dominance-product

$$|\setof{k}{A_{i,k}\le B_{k,j}}|$$

equiv pretty strongly to equality-product

# un-named

$$\min_k \setof{B_{k,j}}{A_{i,k}=1}.$$

# max-min

# $\min$-$\le$

# "witness matrix"

Imagine you have a matrix product like $\min, \odot$ for some
nice operation $\odot$.
The witness matrix is 

$argmin_k A_{i,k}\odot B_{k,j}$
