SCC are super cool and super useful. but how to compute them?

beg defn
Let $reach(v)$ denote the set of vertices which vertex  $v$ can
reach, and let $coreach(v)$ denote the set of vertices which
can reach $v$.
end defn
beg defn
A connected component in a directed graph $G$ is a set of
vertices of the form $reach(w)\cap coreach(w)$ for some $w\in
V$. In other words it is a "maximal" set of vertices $W\subseteq
V$ with the
following property:
- For any $w,v\in V$ there is a path from  $w$ to $v$ and a path
    from $v$ to $w$.

So what I mean by maximal is, if you think about it a bit "$x,y$
are both reachable from each other" forms an equivalence relation
and then the equivalence classes are the strongly connected
compoennts (SCCs).
end defn

beg prop
SCC graph is a DAG
end prop

ok, but how can we compute SCC?

beg prop
Let $rev(G)$ denote the graph obtained by flipping all the edges in
$G$. Then a source compoenent in $G$ is a sink component in $rev(G)$ and vice versa.
end prop

1. Compute a post-order of $rev(G)$. 
2. Use this to identify a source component in  $rev(G)$ i.e. a
   sink component in $G$
3. DFS in the sink component and remove it.
4. cross out stuff from the postorder, and then find a new sink
   component.
5. repeat and stuff

wow, it;s linear time algorithm!
