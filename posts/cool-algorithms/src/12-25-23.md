**Work in progress**

In this blog post I summarize "Stronger 3-SUM Lower Bounds for
Approximate Distance Oracles via Additive Combinatorics" by
Abboud Bringmann and Fischer and also discuss the very similar
"Removing Additive Structure in 3sum based reductions" by Jin and
Xu. I will present the results "backwards", because I think this
makes the motivation clear. 
In particular, I will present the results in the following order:

1. Reduction from "sparse all-edges triangle" to $C_4$-enumeration.
2. Reduction from 3SUM instance with $n^{2+\delta}$ additive
   energy to sparse all-edges triangle.
3. Reduction from 3SUM instance with $O(n^{3-\eps})$ additive
   energy to 3SUM instance with $n^{2+\delta}$ additive energy.
4. Reduction from 3SUM instance with $\Theta(n^{3})$ additive
   energy to 3SUM with $n^{3-\eps}$ additive energy.

Before giving the proofs, it will be helpful to state all the
results.

The 3SUM problem is, given a list of numbers, are there any $3$
summing to $0$?
The 3SUM conjecture states that there is no $n^{2-\eps}$
algorithm for 3SUM.
end rmk 

beg thm 
3SUM is "just as hard" when restricted to sets with additive
energy $n^{2.9999}$.
end thm

3SUM is "just as hard" when restricted to sets with $n^{2.0001}$
additive energy.

Fix $\eps>0, k_{\max}\ge 3$. 
The **sparse all-edges triangle** problem is, given an $n$-vertex
graph $G$ where all vertices have degrees in $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$
and where $G$ has at most $O(n^{k/2})$ $k$-cycles for each $k\in
[3,k_{\max}]$ for each edge determine whether the edge is part
of a triangle. Under the 3SUM conjecture there is no
$O(n^{2-\eps})$-time algorithm for sparse all-edges triangle.
end thm 

beg thm 
Assuming the 3SUM conjecture, there is no $C_4$ enumeration
algorithm in time $\widetilde{O}(n^{2-\eps}+t)$ or
$\widetilde{O}(m^{4/3-\eps}+t)$ where $t$ is the number of
$C_4$'s.

# $C_4$ enumeration

In this section we reduce sparse all-edges triangle to
$C_4$-enumeration.

beg pf
Assume that we have a $C_4$ enumeration algorithm with running
time $\widetilde{O}(n^{2-\eps}+t)$ (where $t$ is the number of
$C_4$'s).

Randomly partition the vertex set into $s=n^{\eps/4}$ parts:
$V=V_1\sqcup V_2 \sqcup \cdots \sqcup V_s$.
For each tripple $i,j,k \in [s]^{3}$, we make a graph $G_{ijk}$.
In $G_{ijk}$ we make 4 copies $v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4$ of each vertex
$v\in V_i\sqcup V_j \sqcup V_k$.
We add the following edges:

- $\{v_1, w_2\}$ if $\{v,w\}\in E(G)$
- $\{v_2, w_3\}$ if $\{v,w\}\in E(G)$
- $\{v_3, w_4\}$ if $\{v,w\}\in E(G)$
- $\{v_1,v_4\}$ 

**Claim 1:**
Each triangle in $G[V_i\sqcup V_j \sqcup V_k]$ becomes a $C_4$ in
$G_{ijk}$.

**Claim 2:**
Each $C_4$ in $G_{ijk}$ either corresponds to a $C_4$ in
$G[V_i\sqcup V_j \sqcup V_k]$ or a $C_3$ in $G[V_i\sqcup V_j
\sqcup V_k]$.
And each $C_4,C_3$ in $G$ generates $O(1)$  $C_4$'s in
$G_{ijk}$'s.

Proof by picture of Claims 1 and 2:
![ink_img009](images/ink_img009.png)

**Claim 3:**
Thus, the number of $C_4$'s across all $G_{ijk}$ is at most 
$O(n^{2}/s + n^{3/2})$.
proof: 
Each $C_4$ from $G$ survives the slicing with probability
$1/s^{4}$. Thus, the expected number of survivors is
$ts^{3}/s^{4}$ (where $t$ is number of $C_4$'s).
By assumption there are at most $O(n^{2})$ $C_4$'s in $G$ so this
is bounded by $O(n^{2}/s)$.

The number of triangles in $G$ is $O(n^{3/2})$.

Adding these up gives the desired bound.

<!-- can we do something similar for C6's ? but stronger in terms
of the sparseness? like the sqrt{n} regular is the wrong regime?-->

**claim 4**: Algo run time is $O(n^{2-\eps/4})$.
The run time is bounded by 
$$\sum_{ijk\in [s^{3}]} n^{2-\eps}+t_{ijk} \le
n^{2-\eps+(3/4)\eps} + n^{2-\eps/4} \le \widetilde{O}(n^{2-\eps/4}).$$

This same computation would show that you're toasted if you were
assuming the existence of an $m^{4/3-\eps}$ time algorithm
instead. 

I think the tilde everywhere is because we have given an algo
with a certai expected running time, and in order to boost this
to working in the desired time whp we can repeate it $\log n$
times, terminating if its taking longer than twice the
expectation.

# sparse all-edges triangle

beg pf
Let $G = \F_p^{\log_p n}$ be the group that we're solving 3sum
over. 
Let $G'\subset G$ be a subgroup of $G$ of size $\sqrt{n}$. 

Let $h$ be a function $G\maps (G')^{3}$ (I think a random
projection onto appropriate dimensional space).
Construct a tripartite graph as follows:

Vertex set $X\sqcup Y \sqcup Z$ with
$$X = G'  \times G' \times \{0\},$$
$$Y = G'  \times  \{0\} \times G',$$
$$Z = \{0\} \times G'  \times G' .$$

Edge set: 
edge $\{x,y\}$ if $y=x+h(a)$. etc.

**claim 1**
psuedo-solutions exactly correspond to triangles,
so triangle listing would suffice to sift through all the
pseudo-solutions and find a real solution.

**claim 2**: 
probably not too many triangles

**claim 3:** counting cycles
**claim 4:** degree regularization
**claim 5:** put it all together

**TODO: understand this one more!**

# energy reduction amplification

beg rmk
The Jin, Xu paper shows how to actually get a Sidon set, i.e., a set with the absolute
minimum additive energy. Abboud et al only show how to obtain a set with $O(n^{2.0001})$
additive energy.
The Jin Xu result seems pretty cool, but the results are equaly
good for our applications. I think the Abboud one is a bit
simpler so I will present theirs.

**HASHING!!!!!**

Use some hash functions to subsample your instance. 
Basically in Abboud et al 's language this is just some random
projection.

Intuitively, slicing up the instance kills additive energy faster
than it kills 3sum solutions. So the little boost that we started
with is enough that we can win here. 

**TODO: understand more.**

# energy reduction initial

**Claim 1**: 
(tripartite) 3SUM is easy if one of the sets has bounded
doubling. 
proof:
For sake of intuition, think of the set $A$ as being contained in a
small interval $I$ (In general, $A$ is contained densely in some "approximate
group").

Partition $B,C$ into $B_1,B_2,\ldots, $ and $C_1,C_2,\ldots$ by
covering them with disjoint translates of $A$.

Call $(i,j)$ **relevant** if it could possibly be the case that
 $A+B_i \cap -C_j \neq \varnothing$ just based on the intervals
 that are covering the dudes.  Observe that $A+B_i$ is contained
 in a small interval, so it only intersects  $O(1)$ $C_j$'s.
 Then we do the following:

```python
for relevant i,j:
  if Bi and Cj are both small (size smaller than n^{1/3}):
    brute force check if there is any b in Bi and c in Cj for
    which b+c in -A
  else if one of Bi, Cj is large:
    Use FFT to compute Bi + Cj. Then check if Bi + Cj has
    non-empty intersection with -A
```

Run time: 

- light: $n\cdot n^{2/3}$ ($n$ many, $n^{2/3}$ brute cost)
- heavy: $n\log n\cdot n^{2/3}$ ($n^{2/3}$ many, $n$ fourier cost)
- total: $\widetilde{O}(n^{5/3})$.

**TODO: talk about Ruzsa covering lemma, and just generally how
you do this**

Now that we have claim 1, we give the following algo for the
initial energy reduction:

```python
while additive energy > n^{2.999}:
  A' = use BSG to peel off a set with bounded doubling
  check if A' is useful for any 3SUM solutions using the fast
  bounded doubling 3sum algo.

  if: 
    so, return the found solution
  else:
    Evict A' and keep going
if size is really small: 
  brute force solve
```

**Claim 2:** As long as the additive energy is larger than
$n^{2.999}$ we almost certainly can do the peeling off step and
its probably fast.
So, either the size gets too small in which case we can afford to
just brute force and find a solution, or if not then we have
reduced to a reasonable 3sum instance just with slightly subcubic
additive energy.

**TODO: argue more formally that this works. **
