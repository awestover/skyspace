tree width chapter
{body}

The thing to wrap your head around in all of these algorithms is
that vertices appear in a bunch of different places, but those
places are "contiguous" and satisfy nice "separation" properties.

beg thm
Maximum weighted independent set in a tree has an easy dynamic program.

In a general graph it is quite a difficult question.

However, suppose that your graph is a subgraph of a not-so-tall
grid. In particular a grid of height $k$.
In this case we can also give a pretty nice DP.

We sweep over columns. 
Each column just needs to know which of the up to $k$ vertices in
the previous column were chosen. There are $2^{k}$ possibilities.
So our DP table has an entry for each possibility.

The most important property we needed here was "separators".

beg def 
Nice Path decomposition:
A sequence of **bags** (which are subsets of the vertex set) such
that:

- First and last bags are empty
- At each step we either **introduce** a new vertex or **forget**
    a vertex (we introduce and forget each vertex exactly once)
    compared to the previous bag.
- For each edge $uv$ there is a bag that contains both endpoints
    of the edge.

The **width** of a path decomposition is the size of the largest
bag minus one.

end def

beg def
We say that $(A, B)$ is a separation of a graph if $A\cup B = V$,
and if there are no edges between  $A\setminus B$ and  $B
\setminus A$.

For a set $A$ we define border $\partial A$ aas the set of
vertices of $A$ with a neighbor in $V\setminus A$.
Note that 
$(A, \partial A \cup (V\setminus A))$ is a separation.

end def

beg lem
Each bag $X_i$ in a path decomposition separates vertices that
occur before bag $i$ and vertices that occur after bag $i$.
end lem

beg def
A **TREE decomposition** of a graph $G$ is: 

A tree $T$ and a bag associated with each *node* of $T$
satisfying:

- Each vertex of $G$ in at least one of the bags.
- For each edge in $G$ there is a bag containing both of the edge's endpoints.
- For each vertex $v$ the set of bags that contain
    $v$ induces a connected subtree of $T$.

Treewidth: size of largest bag minus 1

Path decomposition: tree decomposition + $T$ must be a path.

examples: 
cycle has tree width 2
tree / forest has tree width 1

tree width of planar graph is $O(\sqrt{n})$
tree width of  $K_n$ is $n-1.$
end def

beg lem
Let $ab$ be an edge in $T$.

Let $T_a$ be the connected component resulting from deleting edge
 $ab$ and taking the component that contains $a$.
 let $T_b$ be the other component.

 Let $A$ be the union over verices in $T_a$ of their bags.
 Let  $B$ be similar for $T_b$.

 Then $(A,B)$ is a separation of $G$.

end lem

beg def
**nice tree decomp**

three types of vertices:

- join: join two identical nodes
- introduce: node with a single child. This node's bag has one
    extra element compared to child.
- forget: node with a single child. This node's bag has one fewer
    element than its child.

leaves and root empty

Here's a nice tree decomposition of a tree:
![ink_img010](images/ink_img010.png)

as with path decomps there is an efficient algo to turn an
arbitrary path decomp into a nice one
end def

# now some algorithms

note: 
- for now we're just going to assume the algorithms get a tree
decomp as part of input.

- later we are going to show how to do a pretty decent approx
    algo for tree width.

- even later we will show that sometimes thinking about tree
    width is useful even if we aren't parameterizing by it. 
    For example, if the treewidth is large then maybe we can
    instantly conclude our problem is a no-instance. in this
    win-win manner treewidth is helpful: either we get a tree
    decomp or an obstacle.

## weighted IS

beg pf
In the DP each node in the tree computes, for all possible
subsets of the nodes in its bag to include, what the best stuff
is for its subtree.

To prove correctness we analyze the four types of nodes:

- leaves (base case)
- introduce
- forget
- join

The separation property lets us get nice algorithms.

For instance, lets talk about introduce nodes:
Let $X_t$ be an introduce node with child  $X_{t'}$, where the
vertex introduced at $X_t$.
Fix a subset $S\subset X_t$.
First, check if $S$ is independent. If not, set $c[t, S] =
-\infty$.
Else, split into two cases:

- If $v\notin S$ then the answer is $c[t',S]$. This is clear.
- If $v\in S$ then the answer is $c[t', S\setminus\{v\}] + w(v)$.
  It's pretty clear you can't hope to do better than this.
  Slightly less obvious why you can do this well.
  The reason is, if you let $\hat{S'}$ be the best set for
  $c[t', S\setminus\{v\}]$ then $v$ has no edges to $\hat{S'}$
  because  $v$ has no edges in $\hat{S'}\cap X_{t'}$ due to  $S$
  being independent and $S\setminus\{v\} = \hat{S'}\cap X_{t'}$.
  But also  $v$ has no edges in $\hat{S'}\setminus X_{t'}$ by the
  separation property.
  Anyways this means you can take $v$.

end pf

## dom set

beg rmk
graph of tree width $k$ has at msot $kn$ edges.
end rmk

beg def
We slightly modify the nice tree decomposition definition to be
**extra nice**: now we have "introduce edge bags".

algorithm for turning a nice tree decomposition into an extra
nice tree decomp: put the edge introduce bags between the highest
node containing a vertex and the vertex forget bag that used to
be that bag's parent.

Now instead of just looking at $G[V_t]$ the induced subgraph on
the bag subtree rooted at $t$, 
we look at $G_t$ which is like $G[V_t]$ except in only includes
edges whose edge add bag are in the subtree rooted at $t$.

end def

beg thm 
dom set in graphs of bounded tree-width is FPT
end thm
beg pf
instead of just having a 2 coloring of the vertices in each bag
we now have a 3 coloring:

- black: must be included in partial solution
- white: not contained in partial solution, and must be dominated by the partial solution
- grey: not in partial solution. doesn't matter whether they're
    dominated by it or not.

now we give the DP

- leaf node (base case): trivial
- introduce vertex node: added vertex is isolated. so, if it's black
    $+1$, if its white  $+\infty$, if its grey $+0$. 
- introduce edge node: adding an edge can allow you to relax
    stuff to grey
- forget node: force that guy not to be grey
- join node: if $v$ black in both then black in join. grey iff
    grey in both. white else.

end pf


## steiner tree

connectivity. 
makes run-time slightly worse 

so as part of the state with each node you store a partition of
the vertices in the bag. 

the partition basically corresponds to connected components of a
forest that you're building.
