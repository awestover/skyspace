I read chapter 2 of the FPT book in a bit more detail.
And try some more problems.

# Simple Kernels

Vertex cover is covered (hahahaha) in a different blog post.

FAST: Feedback arc set in Tournaments

(find a set of edges "hitting" all the cycles)

beg lem
A minimal (in the sense that if you delete any edge from the set
the property fails; not necessarily minimum) set of edges in the
whose reversal in the tournament results in a DAG is also a
minimal (in the same sense as above) feedback arc set.
end lem
beg pf

end pf

beg thm 
nice kernel for FAST
end thm
beg pf

- must take edges involved in more than $k+1$ triangles
- is safe to delete vertices not involved in any triangle
- at this point I think you get a bound of like $O(k^{2})$ on
    number of edges in a YES instance based on the two above reductions.

end pf

ECC: edge clique cover. 
cover edges by cliques.

beg thm 
$2^{k}$ sized kernel
end thm
beg pf

- it is safe to delete connected components which are already cliques (and decrease $k$ by one here).
- it is safe to merge "true twins": vertices with identical (closed) neighborhoods.

    At this point we claim that in any YES instance there are at
    most $2^{k}$ vertices left. 
    Assume for contradiction that we have a YES instance, i.e.,
    there are cliques $C_1,C_2,\ldots, C_k$ covering all the
    edges, but we have more than $2^{k}$ vertices. 

    Then associate a $k$-bit vector with each vertex indicating
    which of the $C_i$ clique's its part of.

    By pidgeon two vertices share an indicator vector. That means
    they are true twins, a contradiction.

end pf


A solved problem: can you delete k vertices to make a graph have
max-degree $d$?
Pretty similar rules to VC. 
One interesting one is, you have high-deg and low-deg vtxs. And
you can just toss vertices which aren't adjacnet to any high-deg
vertices. 


# LP-based kernels

A lot of NP-hard problems are easily phrased as ILPs.
ILP is hard. But often we can get a lot of info about what the
ILP solution should look like by relaxing to an LP.

Vertex cover LP relaxation:

$$\forall uv\in E, x_u + x_v \ge 1$$
$$\forall v\in V, x_v \in [0,1]$$
$$\min \sum_{v\in V} x_v.$$
We can think of this as a "fractional vertex cover".

beg lem
Take an LP solution.
Let $V_0$ be vertices in the LP solution with $x_v< 1/2$
Let $V_{1/2}$ be vertices with $x_v=1/2$ and finally let $V_1$ be
vertices with $x_v>1/2$.

Then, it turns out that there is a minimal vertex cover $S$
satisfying:

$$V_1 \subseteq S \subseteq V_1\sqcup V_{1/2}.$$
end lem
beg pf

Take any minimum vertex cover $S^*$. 
Form $S$ by taking $S^{*}$ and removing the $V_0$'s and adding
any missing $V_1$'s.

Claim: $S$ is also a minimum VC.
proof: by contradiction.
Specifically, assume $S$ is a worse VC.
Turns out we can use this to show that the LP solution that
generated $V_0,V_{1/2},V_1$ was actually suboptimal.

end pf

beg thm
Vertex Cover kernel
end thm
beg pf
Run LP (actually you don't need to, you can do some kinda flow thing
instead of actually running LP; but same effect).

Toss $V_0$. Take $V_1$. Size of $V_{1/2}$ can't be too large or
we auto reject.
