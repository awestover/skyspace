# Simple Kernels

Vertex cover is covered (hahahaha) in a different blog post.

FAST: Feedback arc set in Tournaments

(find a set of edges "hitting" all the cycles)

beg lem
A minimal (in the sense that if you delete any edge from the set
the property fails; not necessarily minimum) set of edges in the
whose reversal in the tournament results in a DAG is also a
minimal (in the same sense as above) feedback arc set.
end lem
beg pf

![proof](src/images/FASTFPT.jpg)

end pf

beg thm 
nice kernel for FAST
end thm
beg pf

- must take edges involved in more than $k+1$ triangles
- is safe to delete vertices not involved in any triangle
- at this point I think you get a bound of like $O(k^{2})$ on
    number of edges in a YES instance based on the two above reductions.

end pf

ECC: edge clique cover. 
cover edges by cliques.

beg thm 
$2^{k}$ sized kernel
end thm
beg pf

- it is safe to delete connected components which are already cliques (and decrease $k$ by one here).
- it is safe to merge "true twins": vertices with identical (closed) neighborhoods.

    At this point we claim that in any YES instance there are at
    most $2^{k}$ vertices left. 
    Assume for contradiction that we have a YES instance, i.e.,
    there are cliques $C_1,C_2,\ldots, C_k$ covering all the
    edges, but we have more than $2^{k}$ vertices. 

    Then associate a $k$-bit vector with each vertex indicating
    which of the $C_i$ clique's its part of.

    By pidgeon two vertices share an indicator vector. That means
    they are true twins, a contradiction.

end pf

# LP-based kernels

A lot of NP-hard problems are easily phrased as ILPs.
ILP is hard. But often we can get a lot of info about what the
ILP solution should look like by relaxing to an LP.

Vertex cover LP relaxation:

$$\forall uv\in E, x_u + x_v \ge 1$$
$$\forall v\in V, x_v \in [0,1]$$
$$\min \sum_{v\in V} x_v.$$
We can think of this as a "fractional vertex cover".

beg lem
Take an LP solution.
Let $V_0$ be vertices in the LP solution with $x_v< 1/2$
Let $V_{1/2}$ be vertices with $x_v=1/2$ and finally let $V_1$ be
vertices with $x_v>1/2$.

Then, it turns out that there is a minimal vertex cover $S$
satisfying:

$$V_1 \subseteq S \subseteq V_1\sqcup V_{1/2}.$$
end lem
beg pf

Take any minimum vertex cover $S^*$. 
Form $S$ by taking $S^{*}$ and removing the $V_0$'s and adding
any missing $V_1$'s.

Claim: $S$ is also a minimum VC.
proof: by contradiction.
Specifically, assume $S$ is a worse VC.
Turns out we can use this to show that the LP solution that
generated $V_0,V_{1/2},V_1$ was actually suboptimal.

end pf

beg thm
Vertex Cover kernel
end thm
beg pf
Run LP (actually you don't need to, you can do some kinda flow thing
instead of actually running LP; but same effect).

Toss $V_0$. Take $V_1$. Size of $V_{1/2}$ can't be too large or
we auto reject.

end pf

# Crown Lemma

We say a matching "saturates" a set if there is an edge incident
to all the vertices in that set.

KONIG
- bip. graph: max matching = min vertex cover

HALL: bip graph $G$ with vertex bipartition $(V_1,V_2)$.
- $G$ has a matching saturating $V_1$ iff for all $X\subset V_1$
    we have $|N(X)|\ge |X|$.

beg lem
We can use flow or whatever to find max-matching / min-vertex
cover in $O(m\sqrt{n})$ time.

If the max-matching doesn't saturate $V_1$, we can find a witness
$X\subseteq V_1$ for which $|N(X)|< |X|.$
end lem

beg defn 
Crown: 

CHR

C is an indep set. And non-empty
there is a C,H matching saturating H.
There are no edges between C,R.

end defn

beg thm
there is a poly time algo that, on any graph with at least $3k+1$ vertices either

1. outputs a matching of size $k+1$ 
2. finds a crown decomposition
end thm

beg thm
we can use crown lemma to make a kernel for VC.
end thm
beg pf
Run crow decomp algo. If you find a matching of size $k+1$ output
NO.
Else, you can take the "head" in the crown decomp, and ditch the
crown. This allows us to decrease the problem size as long as the
problem size is at least $3k+1$. Hence $O(k)$ vertex kernel.
end pf

beg thm
MAX SAT has a kernel with $O(k)$ vars  $O(k)$ clauses.
end thm
beg pf
end pf


# Expansion lemma

Now we do a more powerful version of the crown lemma.

beg defn
A **$q$-expansion** of $A$ into $B$ is each vertex in $A$ has
exactly $q$ neighbors in $B$ and these neighbors are disjoint,
i.e., $q|A|$ of the vertices in  $B$ are hit.

You can also think of this as a collection of $q$ edge-disjoint
matchings, each saturating $A$.
end defn


Now we give a generalization of Hall's theorem:
beg lem
Let $G$ be a bip graph with bipartition $(A,B)$.
There is a  $q$-expansion from $A$ into $B$ iff $|N(X)|\ge q|X|$
for all  $X\subseteq A$. Furthermore, if there is no such
$q$-expansion we can find a witness in poly time.
end lem
beg pf

Replace $A$ with $q$ copies of $A$. Run Hall's theorem on the new
graph.
Matchings in this new graph correspond to $q$-expansions in the
original graph.
end pf

beg lem
EXPANSION LEMMA

Suppose we have a bip graph on vtxs $A,B$ with $|B|\ge q|A|$ and
that there are no isolated vtxs in B.

Then there are $X\subseteq A,  Y \subseteq B$ such that
$q$-expansion of $X$ into $Y$. No vertex in $Y$ has a neighbor
outside of $X$, i.e., $N(Y)\subseteq X$.
end lem
beg rmk
$X, Y, V\setminus (X\cup Y)$ is a crown decomp but with even more
properties: not only is every vertex of  $X$ matched into $Y$ but
there is a $q$-expansion of $X$ into $Y$.
end rmk

# Sun-flower

beg defn
SUNFLOWER:

$k$ petals, core $Y$:
sets $S_1,S_2,\ldots, S_k$ such that $S_i \cap S_j = Y$ for all
$i\neq j$ and the "petals"  $S_i \setminus Y$ are all required
to be non-empty.

The core can be empty though.
end defn

beg thm
Family of sets over a universe. Each set has $d$ elements. 
If you have more than $d!(k-1)^{d}$ such sets then the family
contains a sunflower with $k$ petals. And we can compute it in
poly time in terms of the numebr of sets, universe size and $k$.
end thm
beg pf
induction

# some exercises

beg prop
2.4 "In the Point Line Cover problem, we are given a set of n points in the plane
and an integer k, and the goal is to check if there exists a set of k lines on the plane that
contain all the input points. Show a kernel for this problem with $O(k^{2})$ points."
end prop
beg pf 
If any line has more than $k$ points on it, you better take that
line. First run this reduction. 
Now wlog each line has at most $k$ points on it. 
Now, if there are more than $k^{2}$ points output REJECT.
Else, we have our desired kernel.
end pf

beg prop
"2.7. In the Minimum Maximal Matching problem, we are given an
undirected graph G and a positive integer k, and the objective is
to decide whether there exists a maximal matching in G on at most
k edges. Obtain a polynomial kernel for the problem
(parameterized by k)."
end prop
beg pf

observation 1: 
If $G$ has a $4k$ vertex matching then it certainly can't have a
maximal matching of size at most $k$.

Call a vertex "high degree" if its degree is more than $4k$.
Clearly we must take any edge that has two high-degree endpoints.

So, the set of high-degree vertices will form an independent set
after we apply the first reduction.

So the story is, we are going to eat up to $k$ edges. And in
order for this to be a maximal matching we need it to be the case
that for every edge $e\in E(G)$ we ate an edge that shares an
endpoint with $e$.

We say that an edge $e$ is "neutralized" if we take an edge that
shares an endpoint with $e$. 
Consider an LL edge. 
Observe that each edge we eat neutralizes at most $O(k)$ LL
edges. Hence, if there are more than $\Omega(k^{2})$ such edges
then we can output REJECT: there is no way we are going to
neutralize all the edges. 

Otherwise, we have an instance with at most $k^{2}$ LL edges.
The instance technically might still have a lot of vertices
though. 
However we can clean this up. 
There are at most $O(k)$ H vertices, or else we can't hope to
cover all of the H vertices. 

The final thing we need to clean up is, there might be a ton of L
vertices which are just connected to H vertices. 

But this is kind of silly. 
Call an L vertex **silly** if it only has neighbors which are H
vertices. 

If any H vertex has more than $4k$ silly neighbors just
arbitrarily delete its edges to silly neighbors until it only has $4k$ silly neighbors.
There's no reason to prefer an edge to one silly neighbor versus
another. I think we just have to be a tiny bit careful because
some silly vertices might be connected to multiple H vertices.
That's why we only delete edges to silly vertices for H vertices
with a ridiculously silly amount of silly flexibility. 

To see why this final rule is safe, imagine that initially some
subset $S$ of the H vertices were going to choose edges to silly
vertices. First, for all the H vertices that had fewer than $4k$
silly neighbors they can just take the same edges that they would
have anyways. For H vertices with more than $4k$ silly neighbors
they might have to switch their choice of silly edge. But we can
greedily itteratively choose silly edges for all of them. Because
we left them enough flexibility. Anyways this is a polynomially
sized kernel.

Q2.8:
min-ones-2-sat: is there an assignemnt with at most $k$ ones
satisfying the 2CNF SAT formula?

beg prop
Q2.9: can you delete k vertices to make a graph have
max-degree $d$?
end prop
beg pf
Pretty similar rules to VC. 
One interesting one is, you have high-deg and low-deg vtxs. And
you can just toss vertices which aren't adjacnet to any high-deg
vertices.
