2-server on a circle


# intro
In the k-server problem you have k "servers" located in some
topological space. You recieve a series of "requests", which are
points in the topological space. You must respond to the request
by moving some subset of your servers so that at least one server
goes to the request. We will consider this problem in a metric
space. You objective is to minimize the total distance travelled
by all your servers. More precisely, our objective is to create a
strategy that achieves bounded competitive ratio. We consider
this problem with k=2 and set on a circle, where distance is
measured along the circle.
