"Stronger 3SUM lower bounds via Additive Combinatorics"

In this blog post I summarize "Stronger 3-SUM Lower Bounds for
Approximate Distance Oracles via Additive Combinatorics" by
Abboud Bringmann and Fischer and also discuss the very similar
"Removing Additive Structure in 3sum based reductions" by Jin and
Xu.
