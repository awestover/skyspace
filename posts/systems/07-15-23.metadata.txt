a database question

Imagnie I have a postgres database with ~3000 columns storing boolean "flags" for ~1 billion rows. The "on" flag (1) is quite sparse, say occuring less than 0.1% of the time in each column.
Now, I want to execute a query of the form "select all rows with flags 1,2, 5 and 101"
1. How much space would it take to store such a database? That is, will postgres by default do any sort of compression because of how sparse the "on" flag is?
2. Does postgres by default make queries of this form "fast"? If not, are there well known postgres extensions for this type of query? If not I might write my own, but just want to know if this has already been done.
