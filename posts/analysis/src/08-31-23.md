The lambert-W function $x\mapsto xe^{x}$ turns up surprisingly
often. For some reason I always have had a hard time
approximating it. Today I finally found the "inequalities"
section of the wikipedia page for Lambert-W function, and will

Let $W_0$ denote the real principal inverse of $x\mapsto xe^{x}$.
Then for any $x\ge e$,
$$W_0(x) = \ln x - \ln \ln x + \Theta\left(\frac{\ln\ln x}{\ln
x}\right).$$
end thm

One related really common thing is the following:
inverting $$x\ln x = y.$$
Basically the inverse is approximately $\frac{x}{\ln x}$.
By which I mean, if $f(x)=x\ln x, g(x) = \frac{x}{\ln x}$ then 
$$f(g(x))= x (1-o(1)).$$

Another useful taylor series to keep in mind: for small $x\in
(-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})$ we have
$$\log(1-x) \approx -x-\frac{x^2}{2}.$$
