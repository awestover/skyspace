Let $p_n$ denote the n-th prime. The prime number theorem states that $p_{n}\approx n\log n$.
Let $p_n\#$ denote the product of the first n primes (the "primorial").
Then, $p_n\# \approx e^{n\lg n}$ [source: wikipedia]
$numdivs(n\#) = 2^{n}$ because $n\# = 2\cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot \cdots
\cdot p_n$.

so I guess $2_{n} \ll e^{n\lg n}$, but is still exponential.

$\phi(n) \geq \Omega(n / \lg\lg n)$.
Ok, so  $\phi(n) \geq \Omega(n /\lg n)$ follows immediately from
the prime number theorem; but that's obviously very weak. 
I'm pretty sure that primorials exhibit the smallest $\phi(n)$
behavior of any numbers.
