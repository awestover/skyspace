pi^2/6

{description}
The fact \sum 1/n^2 = \pi^2/6 is well known and celebrated.
In this note we present the simple fourier-analytic proof of this fact.

Say $f(t)$ is an $2L$-periodic even function. The cosine series
for $f$ is defined as $$\frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n
\cos(\pi nt / L)$$ where you compute the coefficients via
inner-products: $$a_i = \frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^{L} f(t) \cos(\pi nt
/ L) dt.$$ Because $\{\cos(\pi n t / L) : n\in \N\}$ forms an
orthonormal basis [nasty integral / trig identity exercise: check
this] for nice $2L$-periodic even functions (note: I'm not
totally sure what the space spanned by these cosines is, ofc it
is not *all* functions, maybe continuous is the right word?)
it is then a basic fact of linear algebra that if we project onto
these basis vectors we get another way of representing the
function.

Well, ok. So one function you could compute the fourier transform
of is the even $2\pi$-periodic extension of the parabola
$t\mapsto t^2.$

If you do so you get, for all $t\in [-\pi,\pi]$
$$t^2 = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{4(-1)^n}{n^{2}}\cos(nt).$$
Evaluating at $\pi$ we find
$$\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{1}{n^{2}} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}.$$
Nice.
