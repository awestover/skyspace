property testing: direct product

{description}
Suppose you had a function that was a direct product. Could you tell? Yup.

PROPERTY: 
If $\exists f_1,\ldots, f_k$ such that 
$$ g(x_1,\ldots, x_k) = (f_1(x_1), \ldots, f_k(x_k)) $$ 
then we say that $g$ is a direct product. We want a test to
distinguish between functions which are close to direct products
and functions which are far from direct products.

So here's the test. I think it was originally introduced by Dinur.

1. Sample $x$ uniformly.
2. Sample a set $A$ of coordinates by including each coordinate
   in $A$ with probability $3/4$. 
3. Sample $y$ as follows: for $i\in A$, just set $y_i = x_i$. For
    $i\notin A$ sample  $y_i$ uniformly.
4. Accept iff $g(y)_A = g(x)_A$.

Here is my attempt at analyzing this (I haven't read the paper
yet).
I think if we can prove the following lemma, then it is gg:
beg lem
$\forall  i\in[k],$ 
 $$ \Pr_{x,y}[g_i(x)=g_i(y)\mid x_i = y_i] \ge 1-100\eps. $$ 
end lem
beg pf
Let $B_1,B_2,B_3,B_4$ be a partition of $[k]\setminus\set{i}$. 
Sample $x^{(0)}$ uniformly randomly.
Sample $x^{(1)}$ by starting with $x^{(0)}$ and then resampling
the coordinates from $B_1$.
Sample $x^{(2)}$ by starting from $x^{(1)}$ and then resampling
the coordinates from $B_2$.
Similar for $x^{(3)}, x^{(4)}$.

Yay coupling. 
Why is this good? 
To be continued after dinner.
