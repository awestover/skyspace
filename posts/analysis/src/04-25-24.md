> Question: \
> Suppose $f$ is a polynomial with small integer coefficients
and that $f(0)\neq 0$. Then, how small can the smallest root of
$f$ be in absolute value?

Wikipedia said that 
[Gershgorin Circle Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershgorin_circle_theorem)
was relevant. I'm not sure why so yet, but here's a proof of that
theorem anyways:
beg thm
Fix complex matrix $A$.
Let $R_i = \sum_{j\neq i} |a_{ij}|$.
Define $D(x, r)$ to be a disc in the complex plane of radius $r$ centered at $x$.

All eigenvalues of $A$ lie in $\bigcup_{i} D(a_{ii}, R_i)$.
end thm
beg pf
Let $x$ be an eigenvector with $Ax=\lambda x$ and let $x_i$ be
the largest absolute value coordinate of $x$. Then 
$$ \sum_j a_{ij} x_j = \lambda x_i $$ 
and so
$$ |\lambda - a_ii| = \sum_{j\neq i} a_{ij} x_j/x_i.  $$ 
Using the triangle inequality we have
$$ |\lambda - a_ii| \le \sum_{j\neq i} |a_{ij}| = R_i.  $$ 
end pf

[actually relevant wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometrical_properties_of_polynomial_roots)

beg thm
Let $P(x) =a_0+a_1x + \cdots + a_n x^{n}$ be a polynomial with
$a_0,a_n\neq 0$.
Then the absolute values of the roots of $x$ are all at most
$1+\max_i \frac{|a_i|}{|a_n|}$.
end thm
beg pf
Let $z$ be a root with absolute value larger than $1$.
$$ |a_n||z^{n}| = | \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i z^{i}| \le \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|a_i||z|^{i} \le \max_i |a_i| \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}|z|^{i} .$$ 
Re-arranging it works.
end pf

beg rmk
The roots of 
$$a_0 + a_1x + \cdots a_n x^{n}$$ 
and 
$$ a_n + a_{n-1}x +\cdots + a_0x^{n} $$ 
are inverses of each other. 
So upper bounds on the absolute values of roots for one of them
can be translated into lower bounds for the other.
end rmk
