Throughout the article we use $p$ to denote a prime number, and
some times will state this but sometimes just leave it implicit.


**question 1:** what are the "most composite numbers?"
Well, there are a lot of different classifications of numbers. 
![src/images/divisordudes.png](src/images/divisordudes.png)

But primorials are pretty good as far as having lots of divisors.
I guess sticking more $2$'s into a number can sometimes be
cheaper than adding another distinct prime factor though. So
primorials aren't really the best, they're just a pretty decent
example of a number with an outrageous number of divisors. 
Let $p_n$ denote the n-th prime. The prime number theorem states that $p_{n}\approx n\log n$.
Let $p_n\#$ denote the product of the first n primes (the "primorial").
Then, $p_n\# \approx e^{n\lg n}$ [source: wikipedia]
$numdivs(n\#) = 2^{n}$ because $n\# = 2\cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot \cdots
\cdot p_n$.

so I guess $2_{n} \ll e^{n\lg n}$, but is still exponential.

Sounds like "collosally abundant numbers" are worth looking out
for though.

# Some facts about $\phi$

Let $\phi(n)$ denote the number of positive integers $k<n$ which
are relatively prime with $n$. For example, $\phi(p)=p-1$. This
is called the Euler Toitent function.

$\phi(n) \geq \Omega(n / \lg\lg n)$.
Ok, so  $\phi(n) \geq \Omega(n /\lg n)$ follows immediately from
the prime number theorem; but that's obviously very weak. I think
the stronger bound can maybe be derived from Merten's theorem?

# Merten's Theorems
<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
$$\sum_{p<n, p \in\text{prime}} \frac{1}{p} \approx \lg\lg n$$
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**

We use "dyadic decomposition", a neat strategy.
Consider the sum of reciprocals of primes on an interval
$(e^i,e^{i+1})$. We can see that, up to a factor of $e$, all
these numbers are about $e^i$. There are about $\frac{e^i}{i}$ of
these numbers (the log in the PNT is a natural log). 
Thus, their sum is about $\frac{1}{i}$. This yields
$$\sum_{p<n, p \in\text{prime}} \frac{1}{p} \approx \sum_{i=1}^{\lg n} \frac{1}{i} \approx \int_{1}^{\lg n} \frac{1}{x} dx \approx \lg \lg n.$$

We remark that we don't need PNT to prove Merten's theorem, but
we use it because it's easier this way.
</div>

<div class="cor envbox">**Corollary.**
$$\prod_{p\leq n,p \in\text{prime}} 1- \frac{1}{p} = \frac{1}{\Theta(\log n)}.$$
$$\prod_{p\leq n,p \in\text{prime}} 1+ \frac{1}{p} = \Theta(\log n).$$
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
These theorems are basically just the same thing, but
reciprocalled; thus we will just establish one of them.

Now, to get these other Merten's theorems, we can actually just
observe that they are the exponentiated version of the other identity we proved.
In particular,

$$\log \prod_{p\leq n, p\in\text{prime}} 1+\frac{1}{p} = \sum
\log 1+\frac{1}{p} \approx \sum \frac{1}{p} \approx \lg\lg n.$$

</div>
