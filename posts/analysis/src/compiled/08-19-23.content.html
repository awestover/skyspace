<p>Recurrences pop up a lot. I quite like them for the following reason: - Fairly often you can plot them and guess an approximate / asymptotitc closed form - Then you can prove this hopefully</p>
<p>Sometimes you can hit them with generating functions. But whatever.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s one:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x_{n+1}= x_n + \frac{1}{x_n}.\]</span> Now, this is not afaik ameneble to gfs. But on the other hand, if we remember calculus, we might realize that this has a striking similarity to the linear approximations to the function <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2x}\)</span>. In fact, if you plot this function it basically is just <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{2x}\)</span>, if you seed with an initial condition of <span class="math inline">\(x_1=2\)</span> or something. Cool.</p>
