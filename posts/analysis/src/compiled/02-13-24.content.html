<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is open iff <span class="math inline">\(\overline{X}\)</span> is closed.</li>
<li>(but sets can be both open and closed)</li>
</ul>
<p>In a general topology we just define which sets are open, and they must obey axioms. We say <span class="math inline">\(\tau\subseteq \mathcal{P}(X)\)</span> is a topology on space <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> if it satisfies the following properties:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(\varnothing, X \subset \tau\)</span>.</li>
<li>Any union of elements of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is an element of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</li>
<li>Any intersection of finitely many elements of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span> is an element of <span class="math inline">\(\tau\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Often we work in metric space.</p>
<p>In a metric space:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is an <strong>open set</strong> iff for every point <span class="math inline">\(y\in Y\)</span> there is a ball (aka neighborhood) of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> contained in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a <strong>closed set</strong> iff for every convergent sequence <span class="math inline">\(y_1,y_2,\ldots \in Y\)</span> the limit is contained in <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is <strong>compact</strong> if every open cover has a finite sub-cover</li>
<li><strong>complete space</strong>: limits exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some usefull things to know: A closed subset <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> of a compact set <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is compact. Proof is nice. Take an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. Extend to an open cover of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> by adding <span class="math inline">\(Y\setminus X\)</span> which is an open set because <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is a closed set. Then find a finite subcover for <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Then toss <span class="math inline">\(Y\setminus X\)</span> from that subcover if it was in it. This is now a finite subcover for <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</p>
