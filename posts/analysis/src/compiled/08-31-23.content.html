<p>The lambert-W function <span class="math inline">\(x\mapsto xe^{x}\)</span> turns up surprisingly often. For some reason I always have had a hard time approximating it. Today I finally found the “inequalities” section of the wikipedia page for Lambert-W function, and will share it here.</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(W_0\)</span> denote the real principal inverse of <span class="math inline">\(x\mapsto xe^{x}\)</span>. Then for any <span class="math inline">\(x\ge e\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[W_0(x) = \ln x - \ln \ln x + \Theta\left(\frac{\ln\ln x}{\ln
x}\right).\]</span></p>
</div>
<p>One related really common thing is the following: inverting <span class="math display">\[x\ln x = y.\]</span> Basically the inverse is approximately <span class="math inline">\(\frac{x}{\ln x}\)</span>. By which I mean, if <span class="math inline">\(f(x)=x\ln x, g(x) = \frac{x}{\ln x}\)</span> then <span class="math display">\[f(g(x))= x (1-o(1)).\]</span></p>
<p>Another useful taylor series to keep in mind: for small <span class="math inline">\(x\in (-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})\)</span> we have <span class="math display">\[\log(1-x) \approx -x-\frac{x^2}{2}.\]</span></p>
