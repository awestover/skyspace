Recurrences pop up a lot. I quite like them for the following
reason:
- Fairly often you can plot them and guess an approximate /
    asymptotitc closed form
- Then you can prove this hopefully

Sometimes you can hit them with generating functions. 
But whatever.

Here's one:

$$x_{n+1}= x_n + \frac{1}{x_n}.$$
Now, this is not afaik ameneble to gfs.
But on the other hand, if we remember calculus, we might realize
that this has a striking similarity to the linear approximations
to the function $\sqrt{2x}$.
In fact, if you plot this function it basically is just
$\sqrt{2x}$, if you seed with an initial condition of  $x_1=2$ or
something.
Cool.
