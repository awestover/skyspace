<p>Say <span class="math inline">\(f(t)\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(2L\)</span>-periodic even function. The cosine series for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is defined as <span class="math display">\[\frac{a_0}{2} + \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_n
\cos(\pi nt / L)\]</span> where you compute the coefficients via inner-products: <span class="math display">\[a_i = \frac{1}{L}\int_{-L}^{L} f(t) \cos(\pi nt
/ L) dt.\]</span> Because <span class="math inline">\(\{\cos(\pi n t / L) : n\in \mathbb{N}\}\)</span> forms an orthonormal basis [nasty integral / trig identity exercise: check this] for nice <span class="math inline">\(2L\)</span>-periodic even functions (note: Iâ€™m not totally sure what the space spanned by these cosines is, ofc it is not <em>all</em> functions, maybe continuous is the right word?) it is then a basic fact of linear algebra that if we project onto these basis vectors we get another way of representing the function.</p>

<p>Well, ok. So one function you could compute the fourier transform of is the even <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>-periodic extension of the parabola <span class="math inline">\(t\mapsto t^2.\)</span></p>
<p>If you do so you get, for all <span class="math inline">\(t\in [-\pi,\pi]\)</span> <span class="math display">\[t^2 = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{4(-1)^n}{n^{2}}\cos(nt).\]</span> Evaluating at <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> we find <span class="math display">\[\sum_{n\ge 1}\frac{1}{n^{2}} = \frac{\pi^2}{6}.\]</span> Nice.</p>
