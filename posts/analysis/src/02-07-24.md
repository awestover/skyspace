## topology

- **compact**: every open cover has a finite sub-cover.
- **complete**: limits of cauchy sequences exist
- **open set** (in a metric space): $\forall x\in U, \exists
    \eps>0$ such that  $\setof{y}{d(x,y)<\eps}\subseteq U$. 

- **discrete topology**: all sets are open 
  - is compact iff finite

- **product topology**: minimal amount of open sets to make
    projections $\pi_i : \prod_j X_j \mapsto X_i$ continuous for
    each  $i$.
    - **continuous**: $f^{-1}(\text{open set}) =\text{open set}$
- open sets in the product topology are unions of sets of the
    form 
    $$\prod_i U_i$$
    - where $U_i$ is open in  $X_i$ and $U_i\neq X_i$ for only
        finitely many  $i$.

- **Tychonoff's theorem**: product of compact spaces is compact 

## complex analysis

Derivative:
$$\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h},$$
if it exists, which is a high bar because $h\to 0$ means complex
limit.

**holomorphic** / entire: complex differentiable on domain /
all of $\C$.

ex: polynomials, $\exp$, nice compositions of holomorphic
functions.

Countour integrals

$$\oint_\alpha f(z) dz = \int_a^{b} f(\alpha(t)) \alpha'(t) dt$$


beg thm 
$$\oint \frac{1}{z} dz = 2\pi i.$$

For any integer $m\neq -1$,
$$\oint z^{m} dz  = 0.$$
end thm

beg thm
$\gamma$ a loop, $f$ holomorphic

$$\oint_\gamma f(z) dz = 0.$$

end thm

beg thm
Let $D$ be a disk, and $\gamma$ parameterize the boundary $t\mapsto R\exp(it)$.
Let $f$ be holomorphic.
For any $a$ in the interior of  $D$ we have

$$f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz.$$
end thm
