<p>Read this if you are interested in any of the following questions: "what is a meausre space?", "what's a set in $\mathbb{R}$" that has no well defined inner-measure? / why do measure spaces need $\sigma$-Algebra's defined on them?", "what's a Lesbegue integral?", "what's Lesbegue's dominated convergence theorem?" (_note: work in progress_)
