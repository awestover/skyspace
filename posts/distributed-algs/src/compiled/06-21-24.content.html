<p>I am trying to decide how to transition from skyspace2.0 to skyspace3.0.</p>
<p>There are two proposals.</p>
<p><strong>proposal 1</strong>: Discontinue skyspace2.0.</p>
<p>Ofc I will leave it online, but I will never post on it again. The main reason not to do this is that on the quartz site “<a href="https://awestover.github.io/thoughts/scheduling/scheduling">skyspace3</a>” it’s less easy to see “what have I been posting lately”. The plan to mitigate this would be to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>keep a list of my favorite recent posts</li>
<li>send out an email every month containing my favorite posts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>proposal 2</strong>: Have both 2.0 and 3.0; use them for different things.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <a href="https://awestover.github.io/skyspace">blog</a> (skyspace2.0) is a “LIFO” <strong>stack</strong>. That is, it’s a place where I will post random things that I’ve been thinking about recently. An example use case would be “I hear a cool idea in a math class, and jot it down”, or “I had an interesting experience I’d like to write about and share”.</li>
<li>My wiki (this site) is a <strong>graph</strong>. It’s a network of interconnected ideas (much thanks to Obsidian and Quartz for making the UX and DevX around this so nice and clean!). I aspire to make this wiki more “timeless” than my blog. Revising posts will be the norm rather than the exception (like it is on my blog).</li>
</ul>
<p>The main downside is that this makes my stuff be split over two media. This might make sense if it were a math / non-math divide, but it’s not.</p>
