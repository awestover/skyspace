This is a summary of some interesting facts about QRs that I
found when thinking about a 18.225 pset star question. 

Throughout the post $QR$ will denote the set of quadratic
residues modulo some implicit prime $p$.

Pólya-Vinogradov inequality

The number of quadratic residues in the interval $m+[k]$ is
$\frac{k}{2} \pm \bigO(\sqrt{p}\log p)$.

In fact this is a more general fact about characters.

$$|QR \cap (QR + a)| = \frac{p-3}{4}$$

Quadratic Gauss sum: 

$$\left|\sum_{n=1}^{p} e^{2\pi i \frac{n^{2}}{p}}\right| \le \bigO(\sqrt{p}).$$

I also can basically get this estimate except with some polylog
factors by using Pólya-Vinogradov inequality

Weyl's Criterion 

A sequence $x_1,x_2,\ldots$ is equidistributed iff

$$\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{k=1}^{n} e^{2\pi i k x_k} = 0.$$

This is actually quite powerful. 
It reduces proving equidistribution to estimating a sum,
specifically, showing that the sum is $o(n)$.
But estimating sums is something that seems pretty tractable. 

Terry Tao also says that this is true for multi-dimensional
sequences if you replace the one-dimensional $k x_k$ with the dot product $k\cdot x_k$.

Combining the above results we couuld get that the joint sequence
of $x, x^{2}$ is equidistributed in $\Z_p$.
