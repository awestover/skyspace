<p>Modular forms sound freaking fancy. This post defines the modular group and describes its action on the upper half complex plane. It’s actually a really simple group, it’s generated by two really simple transformations. It makes some really nice pictures. Anyways this post should be really chill it’s just some basic geometric facts. I think it’s kind of cute though. <iframe title="PDF" src="../../pdf_mwe/web0/viewer.html?file=../../posts/number-theory/src/images/modular_forms
