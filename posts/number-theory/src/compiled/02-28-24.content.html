<p>Suppose you want to determine the number of primes in <span class="math inline">\([n,2n]\)</span>. You could write down an “inclusion-exclusion” formula.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[n - \text{num multiples of 2} - \text{num multiples of 3} +
\text{multiples of 6} + \cdots\]</span></p>
<p>But it doesn’t really work. Everything is wrong. The error term completely eats everything.</p>
<p>But say you were interested in a different quantity. How many numbers between <span class="math inline">\([n,2n]\)</span> have all their prime factors larger than <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>?</p>
<p>Then we have a nice truncated inclusion exclusion. If <span class="math inline">\(z&lt;\log n\)</span> say, then the error term isn’t swamped.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(D\subset [n,2n]\)</span> be the set of numbers that have all of their prime divisors smaller than <span class="math inline">\(z\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mu(d)\)</span> be <span class="math inline">\(-1^{\text{number of divisors of d}}\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> is square-free and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> otherwise. We get <span class="math display">\[ \sum_{d\in D} \mu(d) (\frac{n}{d} +O(1)) \le n \prod_{p\le z} (1- \frac{1}{p}) + O(2^{\pi(z)}) = \frac{nc}{\log z}+O(2^{\pi(z)}).\]</span></p>
<p>I think in Elkies lecture notes he uses the Selberg sieve to prove something like a mildly quantitative version of dirichlet’s theorem?</p>
<p>can’t state it here yet, it’s rather technical.</p>

<p>In fact, I think the resource I’m eventually going to use to learn more about this is “Additive Number Theory: The Classical Bases” By Nathanson. It looks to be approachably written. It also talks about sieve theory. So yeah, a book worth checking out for sure. Apostol’s “Intro to Analytic Number Theory” also seems like a resource worth reading. As do the Elkies lecture notes of course.</p>
<p>Suppose we have some (usually infinite) set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and we want to count the number of solutions to the equation <span class="math inline">\(n = a_1+a_2+a_3\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a_1,a_2,a_3\in A\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(r_3(n)\)</span> denote the number of such solutions.</p>
<p>Lots of problems can be described like this.</p>
<ul>
<li>Goldbach’s conjecture: all even numbers larger than 2 can be written as the sum of two primes</li>
<li>Harding Warring problem: express numbers as sum of a bounded number of powers</li>
</ul>
<p>Let <span class="math display">\[f(z) = \sum_{n\ge 0} \mathbbm{1}_A(n) z^{n}.\]</span> Observe that <span class="math display">\[ f(z)^{3} = \sum_{n\ge 0} r_3(n) z^{n}.\]</span></p>
<p>So, the question becomes, is there a nice way to extract the coefficient we want from this sum? The answer is, maybe if you’re lucky.</p>
<p>Consider <span class="math display">\[ \frac{f(z)^{3}}{z^{n+1}}. \]</span> The coefficient of the <span class="math inline">\(1/z\)</span> term in this is precisely the thing we want: <span class="math inline">\(r_3(n)\)</span>.</p>
<p>So I guess we have <span class="math display">\[ r_3(n) = \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)^{3}}{z^{n+1}} .\]</span></p>
<p>Here’s a funny example from the “mathgeeks” youtube channel which I recently ran across (which has some videos half in chinese! which I’ve enjoyed)</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A = \mathbb{N}\)</span>. So <span class="math inline">\(r_3(n)\)</span> is the number of ways to have three numbers that sum to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Of course this is trivial to compute: <span class="math inline">\(\binom{n+2}{2}\)</span> I believe. But here’s how you can do it with analytic number theory:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ f(z) = \sum_{n\ge 0}z^{n} =  \frac{1}{1-z}.\]</span> So we need to compute <span class="math display">\[ \oint_\gamma \frac{1}{(1-z)^{3}} \frac{1}{z^{n+1}} \]</span> You do a Laurent expansion for <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{(1-z)^{3}}\)</span> around <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and then you use cauchy integral formula or whatever. I think we have by the negative binomial formula <span class="math display">\[ (1-z)^{-3} = \sum_{k\ge 0} \binom{-3}{k} (-z)^{k} \]</span></p>
<p>Recall negative binomial coefficient is defined as <span class="math display">\[ \binom{-5}{3} = \frac{(-5)(-4)(-3)}{3!}. \]</span></p>
<p>Anyways we do the integral thing and it turns out to extract the correct coefficient.</p>
<p>So usually when you do the circle method you aren’t going to actually exactly compute the integral in question. You’ll approximate it.</p>
