<h2 id="simple-proofs-that-p_3p_1-are-infinite">Simple proofs that <span class="math inline">\(P_3,P_1\)</span> are infinite</h2>
<p>Assume that <span class="math inline">\(p_1,\ldots, p_n\)</span> is a complete list of the primes congruent to <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> modulo <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>, excluding <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>. Then <span class="math display">\[ 4 p_1\cdots p_n + 3 \]</span> must be divisible by some prime congruent to <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> mod <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>. Of course <span class="math inline">\(p_1\cdots p_n\)</span> is not divisible by <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(4p_1\cdots p_n + 3\)</span> isn’t either. Thus the product must be divisible by one of <span class="math inline">\(p_1,\ldots, p_n\)</span>. But this is impossible by Euclid’s algorithm.</p>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(q_1,\ldots, q_n\)</span> complete list of primes congruent to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> modulo <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>. Then, <span class="math display">\[ (q_1 q_2 \cdots q_n)^2 +1 \]</span> is not divisible by any <span class="math inline">\(P_3\)</span> primes, and is divisible by <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> only once. Thus it should be divisible by <span class="math inline">\(q_i\)</span>, which is impossible by Euclid’s algorithm.</p>

<p>however, these proofs leave something to be desired: <strong>density statements!</strong></p>

<p>Also these proofs don’t generalize well to handling arbitrary APs.</p>

<p>The following proof turns out to generalize nicely to tell you things about density.</p>
<p>Primes are infinite: <span class="math display">\[ \sum_n \frac{1}{n^s}  = \prod_p \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} \]</span></p>
<p>divergence of LHS as <span class="math inline">\(s\to 1^{+}\)</span> implies divergence of RHS, and thus the infinitude of primes, if you’re careful.</p>

<p>Define <span class="math inline">\(L(s) = 1-1/3^{s}+1/5^{s}-\cdots\)</span>. Observe carefully <span class="math display">\[ \ln L(s)  = \sum_p 1-\frac{\lambda(p)}{p^{s}}.\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is a character <span class="math inline">\(1,0,-1,0,\ldots\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then using basic taylor series one can show</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \left|\ln L(s) - \sum_p \lambda(p)/p^{s}\right| \le O(1). \]</span></p>
<p>And you can derive that <span class="math display">\[ \left|\sum_{p\in P_1\cup P_3} \lambda(p)/p^{s}\right| = O(1). \]</span></p>
<p>And this is what we wanted.</p>
