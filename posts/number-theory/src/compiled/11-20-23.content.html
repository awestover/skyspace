<p>GRH = Generalized Reiman Hypothesis.</p>
<p>I’ve always kind of had the vibes that “assuming GRH, then any reasonable randomness statement you could want to make about the primes is true”.</p>
<p>It turns out GRH is a bit more modest then that, which maybe highlights just how little we know about numbers.</p>
<p>But anyways, I looked around at <a href="https://mathoverflow.net/questions/17209/consequences-of-the-riemann-hypothesis">SO</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Riemann_hypothesis">wikipedia</a> and will summarize what I feel seem like some important consequences of GRH.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>GRH implies that there is a generator for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_p^{\times}\)</span> of size at most <span class="math inline">\((\ln(p))^{6}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Also that <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ x&lt; 2(\ln n)^{2}\right\}\)</span> generates <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}_n^{\times}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>GRH implies that prime gap is like <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{p}\log p\)</span></p></li>
</ol>
<p>note that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gap">I think we already know</a> this if you replace <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{p}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(p^{\frac{5}{8}}\)</span> so this one feels less important</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>The number of primes in the arithmetic progression $a, a+d, a+2d, , $ (where <span class="math inline">\(a\perp d\)</span>) is like <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\phi(d)} \frac{x}{\ln x} \pm \sqrt{x}\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p>Furthermore, the first prime <span class="math inline">\(\equiv a \mod n\)</span> is of size at most <span class="math inline">\(O((n\log n)^{2})\)</span></p>
<p>note that we already know this for if you replace <span class="math inline">\(n^{2}\)</span> with likke <span class="math inline">\(n^{6}\)</span> so again, doesn’t seem that pressing.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>if you take a character sum over some interval, e.g., count the number of quadratic residues in some interval of length <span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> then we already know its like bounded by <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{p}\log p\)</span> but under GRH you can replace the log with loglog. Again, not super impressive.</li>
</ol>
<p>So in summary, I think (1) is the only one where assuming GRH really gets you something rather extremely good. huh, that’s really too bad. I wanted to prove hashing conditional on GRH. but this now seems very unlikely to be super helpful.</p>
