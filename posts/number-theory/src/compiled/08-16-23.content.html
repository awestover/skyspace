<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <strong>Minkowski’s theorem:</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> be a bounded convex centrally-symmetric body in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}^n\)</span> with volume larger than <span class="math inline">\(2^{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Then <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> contains a lattice point differnt from the origin.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Make a lattice of cubes of side length <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> and consider <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>’s intersection with these cubes. Translate all the cubes into the origin’s cube. There must be two points <span class="math inline">\(x,y\)</span> that collide. Then <span class="math inline">\(x-y \in 2\mathbb{Z}\)</span> because the translations of all the cubes are even integers. <span class="math inline">\(-y\in S\)</span> becuase <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is centrally-symmetric. But then by convexity <span class="math inline">\(\frac{x-y}{2}\)</span> is a point in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> and of course it isn’t <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>You can also do this for a parallelpiped spanned by some vectors.</p>
<p>This turns out to be really great for number theory. You define an appropriate lattice and an appropriate bounded convex centrally-symmetric body and then you find a nice non-trivial point in your lattice. sorry I’m tired so no example tonight.</p>
<p>maybe next time.</p>
