Modular forms sound freaking fancy.
This post defines the modular group and describes its action on
the upper half complex plane. 
It's actually a really simple group, it's generated by two really
simple transformations. It makes some really nice pictures.
Anyways this post should be really chill it's just some basic
geometric facts. I think it's kind of cute though.
