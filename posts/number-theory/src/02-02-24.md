Breifly review basic algebra definitions.
{body}

I'm trying to brush up on my Algebra before taking an Algebra
class (NT) this semester.
Basically, I should go reread Artin, or find my notes.
Or I can just wikipedia things as they come up.
Anyways, here's a place to write stuff down.

- group
  - ex: $S_n, A_n, D_n$
  - more exs: $SL_n, GL_n, U_n$
  - abelian group: all elements commute
  - normal subgroup: subgroup invariant under conjugation
  - conjugacy class: a set of elements that are all conjugate to
      each other (conjugacy is an equivalence relation)

- ring
  - ex: $\Z[x]$
    - we spend quite a bit of time talking about when polynomials
        are irreducible iirc
  - module: like a vector space but scalars are from a ring
      rather than a field. These can be wacky.

- **field**
  - algebraicly closed field: all non-constant polynomials have roots.
  -
  - field extensions where important
    - you can get an extension, e.g., by adjoining an element
    - in general an extension is just a superset field
    - the degree of an extension $[K: F]$ is the dimension of  $K$ as an $F$ vector space.
    - multiplicative property of field extensions
  - splitting field: a finite field extension in which some given polynomial factors

- vector space
  - ex: $\R$ is a $\Q$ vector space

- representation of a group
  - $\rho: G\to GL(V)$
  - character of a representation: trace
  - reducible: can write as direct sum
  - 1D chars
  - regular rep
  - Shur's lemma
  -
  - irreducible characters are orthonormal
  - number of irreps equals number of conjugacy classes

**Integral Domain**: Commutative ring with no zero divisors
- ex $\Z[x]$
- non-example: $\Z[x,y]/(xy)$ (not an integral domain because
    $x\cdot y = 0$)

**Euclidean Domain**
- an integral domain endowed with a norm function that allows you
    to divide via the euclidean algorithm
- ex: $\Z[i]$ with norm the complex norm or $\Z[x]$ with norm being the degreee of the
    polynomial

**PID** 
- integral domain where every ideal is principal (generated by a
    single element)

**UFD**
- integral domain where you can uniquely factor (modulo units)

**Prime Ideal**
- $ab\in P \implies a\in P \lor b\in P$

**Galois Group**
- Let $K,K'$ be field extensions of $F$. An $F$-isomorphism $\phi: K\to K'$ is an isomorphism that fixes $F$ (is the identity map when restricted to $F$ ).
- If $K\supseteq F$, then the Galois group $G(K/F)$ is the group
    of **$F$-automorphisms** of $K$.
- some deep theorem about a bijection between subgroups of the
    galois group and intermediate field extensions.
