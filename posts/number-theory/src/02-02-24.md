Breifly review basic algebra definitions.
{body}

I'm trying to brush up on my Algebra before taking an Algebra
class (NT) this semester.
Basically, I should go reread Artin, or find my notes.
Or I can just wikipedia things as they come up.
Anyways, here's a place to write stuff down.

- group
  - ex: $S_n, A_n, D_n$
  - more exs: $SL_n, GL_n, U_n$
  - abelian group: all elements commute
  - normal subgroup: subgroup invariant under conjugation
  - conjugacy class: a set of elements that are all conjugate to
      each other (conjugacy is an equivalence relation)

Lagrange's theorem:
Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$. Then $|H| \mid |G|$.
end thm
beg pf
We claim that the relation "$x\sim y$ if $xH = yH$" is an
equivalence relation.
I.e., left cosets form a partition of $G$.

This is true because if $xh_1 = yh_2$ then $x=y h_2h_1^{-1}$.
end pf

- ring
  - ex: $\Z[x]$
    - we spend quite a bit of time talking about when polynomials
        are irreducible iirc
  - module: like a vector space but scalars are from a ring
      rather than a field. These can be wacky.

- **field**
  - algebraicly closed field: all non-constant polynomials have roots.
  -
  - field extensions where important
    - you can get an extension, e.g., by adjoining an element
    - in general an extension is just a superset field
    - the degree of an extension $[K: F]$ is the dimension of  $K$ as an $F$ vector space.
    - multiplicative property of field extensions
  - splitting field: a finite field extension in which some given polynomial factors

- vector space
  - ex: $\R$ is a $\Q$ vector space

- representation of a group
  - $\rho: G\to GL(V)$
  - character of a representation: trace
  - reducible: can write as direct sum
  - 1D chars
  - regular rep
  - Shur's lemma
  -
  - irreducible characters are orthonormal
  - number of irreps equals number of conjugacy classes

- **Integral Domain**: Commutative ring with no zero divisors
  - ex $\Z[x]$
  - non-example: $\Z[x,y]/(xy)$ (not an integral domain because $x\cdot y = 0$)

- **Euclidean Domain**
  - an integral domain endowed with a norm function that allows you
      to divide via the euclidean algorithm
  - ex: $\Z[i]$ with norm the complex norm or $\Z[x]$ with norm being the degreee of the polynomial

- **PID** 
  - integral domain where every ideal is principal (generated by a single element)

- **UFD**
  - integral domain where you can uniquely factor (modulo units)

- **Prime Ideal**
  - $ab\in P \implies a\in P \lor b\in P$

- **Galois Group**
  - Let $K,K'$ be field extensions of $F$. An $F$-isomorphism $\phi: K\to K'$ is an isomorphism that fixes $F$ (is the identity map when restricted to $F$ ).
  - If $K\supseteq F$, then the Galois group $G(K/F)$ is the group
      of **$F$-automorphisms** of $K$.
  - some deep theorem about a bijection between subgroups of the
      galois group and intermediate field extensions.


- **irreducible polynomial**
  - Gauss' lemma: a primitive polynomial (gcd of coefficients is
      a unit) is irreducible over the integers iff irreducible
      over the rationals.
  - another thing: if a polynomial is irreducible over $\F_p[X]$
      then it is also irreducible over $\Z[X]$

- **separable polynomial**
  - roots are distinct in an algebraic closure
  - you can tell if a minimal poly has repeated roots based on
      whether its formal derivative is the zero polynomial
- separable extension: 
  - for every $\alpha\in L$ which is algebraic over  $K$ the
      minimal poly of $\alpha$ over $K$ is separable.

- **splitting field of a poly**: smallest field extension in which
    the poly factors
  - the splitting field is unique up to iso 
  - constructing the splitting field: adjoin roots to split up
      non-linear factors

- **exact sequence**:
  - image of one morphism is the kernel of the next.
  - $im(f_i) = ker(f_{i+1})$
  - ex: $0\to X \to Y \to 0$ means that  $X,Y$ is an isomorphism

# NT chapter 1

$$x\mapsto x^{p}$$ is an automorphism

i.
Field have prime characteristic (or else it violates the fact that
fields have no zero-divisors).

If $\F_q$ has characteristic $p$ then the size of $\F_q$ is a
power of $p$, becuase $\F_q$ is a vector space over $\F_p$.
So, we could just repeatedly project off subspaces of $\F_q$.

ii.
Let $\Omega$ be algebraicly closed.
Then $x\mapsto x^{q}$ is an automorphism of $\Omega$.
Thus, the set of elements fixed by this automorphism, i.e., the
roots of $x^{q}-x$ form a field (you can check that inverses,
sums, etc must lie in the set).
 
Observe that the derivative of $x^{q}-x$ is nowhere zero.
This means that it has no repeated roots.
Thus it has $q$ distinct roots.

For the uniqueness part, if $K$ is a subfield of $\Omega$ with
$q$ elements, then for any $x\in K^{*}$ we have $x^{q-1}=1$,
by Lagrange's theorem: the multiplicative group $K^*$ is a group
with  $q-1$ elements so the order of each element must divide
into $q-1$. Hence $x^{q}=x$ for all $x\in K$.
But then $K\subseteq \F_q$. They have the same cardinality so are
actually equal.

iii.
$\F_q$ is unique.

(not sure why this is so yet)
