## Simple proofs that $P_3,P_1$ are infinite

Assume that $p_1,\ldots, p_n$ is a complete list of the primes
congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, excluding $3$.
Then 
$$ 4 p_1\cdots p_n + 3 $$ 
must be divisible by some prime congruent to $3$ mod $4$.
Of course $p_1\cdots p_n$ is not divisible by $3$ so $4p_1\cdots
p_n + 3$ isn't either. 
Thus the product must be divisible by one of  $p_1,\ldots, p_n$.
But this is impossible by Euclid's algorithm.

Assume $q_1,\ldots, q_n$ complete list of primes congruent to
$1$ modulo $4$.
Then, 
$$ (q_1 q_2 \cdots q_n)^2 +1 $$ 
is not divisible by any $P_3$ primes, and is divisible by $2$
only once. Thus it should be divisible by $q_i$, which is
impossible by Euclid's algorithm.

**density statements!**

APs.

The following proof turns out to generalize nicely to tell you
things about density.

Primes are infinite:
$$ \sum_n \frac{1}{n^s}  = \prod_p \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} $$ 

divergence of LHS as $s\to 1^{+}$ implies divergence of RHS, and
thus the infinitude of primes, if you're careful.

## baby euler products 

Define $L(s) = 1-1/3^{s}+1/5^{s}-\cdots$.
Observe carefully
$$ \ln L(s)  = \sum_p 1-\frac{\lambda(p)}{p^{s}}.$$ 
Here $\lambda$ is a character $1,0,-1,0,\ldots$.

Then using basic taylor series one can show 

$$ \left|\ln L(s) - \sum_p \lambda(p)/p^{s}\right| \le O(1). $$ 

And you can derive that 
$$ \left|{\sum_{p\in P_1\cup P_3} \lambda(p)/p^{s}\right| = O(1). $$ 

And this is what we wanted.
