In this post I will give a proof of Dirichlet's Theorem: in any
(reasonable) infinite arithmetic progression there are infinitely
many primes. Actually we will probably get a nice density
statement that is stronger than this.
{body}

We start with a couple simple ad-hoc proofs for some simple cases
of Dirichlet's theorem.
They are very natural, but don't generalize to the result we
want, and don't give you any type of density result.

## Simple proofs that $4\N+1, 4\N+3$ contain infinitely many primes

The following two proofs are taken from "Problems from the Book"
by Titu Andreescu and Gabriel Dospinescu, but are standard.

Assume that $p_1,\ldots, p_n$ is a complete list of the primes
congruent to $3$ modulo $4$, excluding $3$.
Then 
$$ 4 p_1\cdots p_n + 3 $$ 
must be divisible by some prime congruent to $3$ mod $4$.
Of course $p_1\cdots p_n$ is not divisible by $3$ so $4p_1\cdots
p_n + 3$ isn't either. 
Thus the product must be divisible by one of  $p_1,\ldots, p_n$.
But this is impossible by Euclid's algorithm.

Assume $q_1,\ldots, q_n$ complete list of primes congruent to
$1$ modulo $4$.
Then, 
$$ (q_1 q_2 \cdots q_n)^2 +1 $$ 
is not divisible by any $P_3$ primes, and is divisible by $2$
only once. Thus it should be divisible by $q_i$, which is
impossible by Euclid's algorithm.

These proofs are very elementary, although the second proof
already relies on a non-trivial fact about the classification of
prime factors of numbers of the form $n^2+1$.
However, they are fairly ad-hoc.
Furthermore, these proofs seem to have no hope of proving a
density statement. 

It turns out that the following proof generalizes more nicely,
and also gives you density statements.

The Euler Product Formula states that for any real $s>1$ the
following series/products exist and are equal.
$$ \sum_{n\ge 1} \frac{1}{n^s}  = \prod_p \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} $$ 
It is implicit throughout this note that $p$ runs over primes
when written as an index in a sum or product.
The veracity of the Euler Product Formula is immediate from the
Fundamenal Theorem of Numbers -- the fact that all numbers
can be uniquely decomposed into prime factors -- along with
viewing $\frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}$ as the sum $\sum_{n\ge 0} p^{-ns}$,
and noting that for absolutely convergent sums it is legal to
rearrange terms arbitrarily.
Of course we know that 
$$ \lim_{s\to 1} \sum_{n\ge 1} n^{-s} = \infty. $$ 
This fact is incompatible with having finitely many primes: the
product on the RHS can't grow unboundedly if it is a product over
finitely many terms.

## Simple Euler Products 
We have seen an intruiging proof of the infinitude of the primes.
We now extend this to proving that there are infinitely many
primes in $4\N+1$ and  $4\N+3$.

The following proofs are taken from Andreescu and Dospinescu's
book again, but should probably be attributed to Dirichlet.

Let $\lambda$ be the character with $\lambda(2k) = 0, \lamba(4k+1)=1, \lambda(4k+3)=0$.
Define 
$$L(s, \lambda) = \sum_{n\ge 1} \frac{\lambda(n)}{n^{s}}.$$
For any $s>1$ we have absolute convergence, and thus can
re-arrange terms to achieve:
$$ \ln L(s)  = \sum_p \left(1-\frac{\lambda(p)}{p^{s}}\right).$$ 
Using basic taylor series one can show 
$$ \left|\ln L(s) - \sum_p \lambda(p)/p^{s}\right| \le O(1). $$ 
From here we derive that
$$ \left|\sum_{p} \lambda(p)/p^{s}\right| = O(1). $$ 
On the other hand, we know that 
$$ \lim_{s\to 1} \sum_p p^{-s} \to \infty. $$ 
Thus, there must be a large amount of cancellation occuring in
the sum $\sum_{p} \lambda(p)/p^{s}$. In particular, we must have
that there are infinitely many primes in both  $4\N+1$ and
$4\N+3$.

# Dirichlet Characters
To generalize this idea we need Dirichlet Characters.
[Credit to this is due to this paper by Thai Pham, a previous MIT student.](https://web.stanford.edu/~thaipham/papers/MIT_18.104_Review_Paper.pdf)
For an abelian group $G$ we define the dual $\hat{G}$ as the set
of homomorphisms from $G$ to $\C\setminus\set{0}$.

For example, if $G=(\Z/p\Z)^{*}$ then $\hat{G}$ is functions
$x\mapsto e(xk/p)$ for each $k\in (\Z/p\Z)^{*}$.
This illustrates a general fact:
beg thm
$\hat{G}$ is isomorphic to $G$.
end thm
beg pf
This is clear for cyclic groups and all finite abelian groups can
be written as a direct sum of cyclic groups.
end pf

We will only consider the case $G=(\Z/mZ)^{*}$.
In this case the elements of $G$ are in correspondence with
$\phi(m)$-th roots of unity.

A useful property of the dual group is:
beg lem
We have:

- $\sum_{g\in G}\chi(g) = 0$ unless $g=1$ in which case the sum is $|G|$
- $\sum_{\chi\in \hat{G}} \chi(g) = 0$ unless  $\chi=\id$ in
    which case the sum is $|\hat{G}|$.

$$ \ang{\chi, \phi} = \sum_{g} \chi(g)\overline{\phi(g)} = \one_{\chi=\phi}. $$ 
end lem
These are standard and we omit the proofs.

# Dirichlet Series

Now we proceed with the proof of the theorem.

A key character in the proof will be the Reimann Zeta function.
This is defined as follows.

beg lem
Let $\zeta(s)$ denote the analytic extension of $\sum_{n\ge
1}n^{-s}$ for $\Re(s)>1$ to a meromomorphic function on the whole
complex plane. This extension exists and is holomorphic except
for a pole at $s=1$.
end lem
beg pf
The typical way that analytic extensions work is by having a
functional equation that extends the definition of your function.
We will actually only require the Reimann zeta function on
$\Re(s)>0$, for which we can perform the extension using the
following simple observation:
$$\sum_{n\ge 1} n^{-s} - 2 (2n)^{-s} = \zeta(s)\left(1 - 1/2^{s-1}\right) = \sum_{n\ge 1} (-1)^{n-1}/n^{s}. $$
The RHS converges for all $s$ with $\Re(s)>0$.
Thus, for $s\in \C$ with $\Re(s)>0$ and $s\neq 1$ we can define
$$ \zeta(s) = \frac{1}{1-2^{1-s}} \sum_{n\ge 1} \frac{(-1)^{n-1}}{n^{s}}.$$
