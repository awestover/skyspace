a little bit about quadratic residues

\newcommand{\legendre}[2]{\left( \frac{#1}{#2} \right) }

The legendre symbol $\legendre{a}{p}$ is just $\pm 1$ : $+1$ if
$a$ is a quadratic residue $\mod p$ and $-1$ if $a$ is a quadratic non-residue.

beg prop
$$\legendre{a}{p} \equiv a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \bmod p$$
end prop
beg pf
If $a$ is a quadratic residue then $a^{\frac{p-1}{2}}\equiv 1 \mod p$ by FLT.
In fact this is iff.
end pf

beg prop
There are $\frac{p-1}{2}$ quadratic residues $\mod p$. 
They are the roots of the poly $X^{\frac{p-1}{2}}-1$ 
and the non-residues are roots of $X^{\frac{p-1}{2}}+1$.
end prop
beg pf
by FLT $X^{p-1}-1$ has  $p-1$ roots. Factor the poly. factors num
roots is same as its degree. 
Observe that  $i^{2}$  for $i\le \frac{p-1}{2}$ is a set of
distinct numbers which are all quad residues.

Ok the reason they are distinct is because if  $i^{2}-j^{2}
\equiv 0$ then basically we need $i+j =p$ but that wont happen by
virtue of  $i\neq j$ and the range we chose them in.
end pf

beg prop
Legendre symbol plays nicely with multiplication
end prop

# really understanding it

To really understand it we need some lattice geometry stuff.

Let $\eta_n(a)$ denote the unique  $a'\equiv a \mod n$ such that
 $a'\in (-\frac{n}{2}, \frac{n}{2}]$.
beg lem
Let $k$ count the number of $j\in [\frac{p-1}{2}]$ such that
$\eta_n(ja) <0$. Then 
$$\legendre{a}{p} = (-1)^{k}.$$
end lem
beg pf
**Hmm. I dont quite get this yet** But here's a proof anyways
Observe that $\setof{|\eta_n(aj)|}{j\in [\frac{p-1}{2}]}$
contains each element of $[\frac{p-1}{2}]$. This is because
$$|aj|\equiv |ai| \implies i\pm j \equiv 0$$
which is impossible for distinct $i,j\in [\frac{p-1}{2}]$.

But then $$(-1)^{\ell}\equiv a^{\frac{p-1}{2}} =
\legendre{a}{p}.$$
end pf

But now we have the famous result, quadratic reciprocity
beg thm 
$$\legendre{p}{q}\legendre{q}{p} = (-1)^{\frac{p-1}{2}\frac{q-1}{2}}.$$
end thm
beg pf 
Using our condition above this actually becomes a geometric
problem.
Basically there is a rectangle
$[\frac{q-1}{2}]\times[\frac{p-1}{2}]$ and we are concerned with
certain lattice points in it.
Let $k_p,k_q$ be the number from the lemma above.
In the end we end up wanting to show that 
$$\frac{p-1}{2}\frac{q-1}{2} - (k_p+k_q)$$ is even. 
This counts lattice points in the rectangle which are not of some
certain form. We break it into two regions and show a bijection
between them to conclude.
Here's a visualization:
![quadrep](src/images/quadrecip.png)
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot  as plt

p = 101
q = 223

def typeRed(x,y):
    return q*y-p*x >= q/2
def typeBlue(x,y):
    return q*y-p*x <= -p/2
def typeBlack(x,y):
    return not typeRed(x,y) and not typeBlue(x,y)

def unpack(array):
    flat = []
    for L in array:
        flat += L
    xs = [pair[0] for pair in flat]
    ys = [pair[1] for pair in flat]
    return xs, ys

def typeXs(typeFn):
    type_matrix = [[(x,y) for x in range(q//2) if typeFn(x,y)] for y in range(p//2)]
    return unpack(type_matrix)

plt.scatter(*typeXs(typeRed), c='r', alpha=.5)
plt.scatter(*typeXs(typeBlue), c='b', alpha=.5)
plt.scatter(*typeXs(typeBlack), c='k')
plt.show()
```
