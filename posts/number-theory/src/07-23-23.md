Farey Numbers

{description}
The $k$-Farey numbers are reduced fractions of denominator at
most $k$. They have several very interesting properties and are
super useful. We investigate some of these properties.

We denote the Farey numbers by $F_n$. 

beg prop
1. When you go from $F_n$ to $F_{n+1}$ the inserted numbers are
mediants.
2. Consecutive Farey fractions $\frac{a}{b}, \frac{c}{d}$ have
   difference $\frac{1}{bd}$

1. There is a relatively straightforward inductive proof

2. I like this constructive proof better though:

We construct the successor to $\frac{h}{k}$ in $F_n$.
Take $x,y$ solving $kx-hy = 1$; they must exist because $h\perp
k$. In fact, if $x,y$ are a solution then so is $x+rh,y+rk$ for
any $r\in \Z$.
So take $r$ such that  $n-k<y\le n$.

Now, imagine that $\frac{x}{y}$ is not the successor of $\frac{h}{k}$ despite having $\frac{h}{k}-\frac{x}{y}=\frac{1}{ky}$.
Then we must have coprime $h',k'$ which is between $\frac{h}{k}$
and $\frac{x}{y}.$

We compute:
$$\frac{x}{y}-\frac{h'}{k'} \ge \frac{1}{k'y}$$
$$\frac{h'}{k'}-\frac{h}{k} \ge \frac{1}{k'k}$$
We already knew
$$\frac{x}{y}-\frac{h}{k} = \frac{1}{ky}.$$
Combining these equations gives
$$\frac{1}{ky} \ge \frac{1}{k'} (\frac{1}{y}+\frac{1}{k}) > \frac{1}{ky}$$
a contradiction.

3. Then they give a geometrical proof :O. I'm hyped lets see
   this.

   ok actually I didn't understand the lattice proof right now.
   I will come  back to it later maybe
