{description}
I've found a cool set of lecture notes from Harvard that talks
about analytic number theory. In this post I give some of the
basic ideas presented in the first couple notes.

# introducing euler product / zeta function

The Euler Product:
The birth of AnalyticNT.
For all $s\in \C$ with  $\Re[s]>1$ we have
$$\zeta(s) =  \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{-s} = \prod_p \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}}. $$ 
end thm
beg pf
Thus sum on the left converges absolutely, so you can re-arrange
terms however you want.

If we expand out the sum 
$$ \prod_p \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} p^{-i} $$ 
We get a terms $n^{-s}$ for every $n\in \N$.

This is by the fundamental theorem of numbers: you can decompose
them into prime factors.

An interesting consequence of this Euler Product thing is that
the prime counting function $\pi$ (how many primes are there up
to a certain point) satisfies
$\pi(n) > \Omega(n^{1-\eps})$ for any $\eps>0$.
end prop
beg pf
Suppose that $\pi(n) \le O(n^{1-\eps})$.
Fix $s = 1-\eps/2$.

Fix some $n_0$ and let $A$ denote the set of primes between
$n_0,2n_0$.
Then, 
$$ \prod_{p\in A} \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} \approx (1+\frac{1}{n_0^{1-\eps/2}})^{n_0^{1-\eps/2-\eps/2}} \approx e^{n_0^{-\eps/2}}. $$ 

So, 
$$ \prod_p \frac{1}{1-p^{-s}} \approx \exp\left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} (2^{-\eps})^{n}\right) <\infty.$$ 
But this is ridiculuous because $\zeta(1-\eps/2) = \infty$.

beg prop
A sometimes useful estimate:
$$ \frac{1}{s-1} \le \zeta(s) \le \frac{1}{s-1}+1.$$ 

Follows from basic calculus
end prop

beg thm
For any $s\in (1,2)$,
$$ \left|\sum_{p} p^{-s} - \log \frac{1}{s-1}\right| \le O(1). $$ 
end thm
beg pf
By taylor series / desmos:
$$ \log\zeta(s) = \sum_p -\log(1-p^{-s}) \approx \sum_p p^{-s}. $$ 

From earlier (calculus):
$$ \log\zeta(s) \in ( \frac{1}{s-1}, \frac{1}{s-1} + 10). $$ 
end pf

beg thm
$$ \sum_p p^{-s} =  s\int_1^{\infty} \pi(y) y^{-s-1} dy. $$ 
end thm
beg pf

Well, $p^{-s} = s\int_p^{\infty}y^{-s-1}dy.$ 
If you do 
$$ \sum_p  \int_p^{\infty} y^{-s-1}$$ 
you indeed pick up $\pi(y)$ terms $y^{-s-1}$.

This is sometimes called the mellin transform. It's maybe a sort
of laplace transform?
end pf

beg prop
Meme:
The fact that $\zeta(2)= \pi^2/6\notin \Q$ implies that there are
infinitely many primes.

In fact there are some theorems that show that $\pi$ is "very
far from rational". But these still only allow you to prove
really weak things like $\pi(n) > \log\log n$.
end prop

beg ex
There are $n^2/\zeta(2) + O(n\log n)$ ordered pairs of relatively
prime numbers in $[n]^2$.
