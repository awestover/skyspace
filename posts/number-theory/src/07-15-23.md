For integers $x,y$ we write $x\perp y$ to denote  that $x,y$ are
coprime. Let $s(n)$ denotote the digit sum of $n$ when written in
binary, and $f(n)$ denote  $\nu_2(n!)$. Without loss of
generality, assume $a\in [0, b).$

The following relationship between $s,f$ is well-known:
$$f(n) = n-s(n).$$

We break our problem into 3 cases.

**Case 0:** $b=1$
This is trivial.

**Case 1:** $b\perp 2$.

Then, Euler's theorem says $2^{\phi(b)} \equiv 1 \mod b.$
Thus, 
$$f(2^{\phi(b)}x) = 2^{\phi(b)}x - s(x) \equiv x-s(x) \mod b
\equiv f(x).$$
Of course, $f(2) = 1.$
Thus, 
$$f(\sum_{i=1}^{a} 2^{i\phi(b)}\cdot 2) \equiv a \mod b.$$

**Case 2:** $b=2^{k}$.

Then $f(2^{k}m) \equiv s(m) \mod b.$
So 
$$f(2^{k}\sum_{i=1}^{a}2^{i}) \equiv a \mod b.$$

**Case 3:** $b=c \cdot 2^{k}$ for $c\perp 2$.

By Case 1, $\exists n_1$ such that 
$$f(n_1)\equiv a \mod c.$$

Clearly $2^{\ell}\bmod 2^{k}c$ cycles through multiples of $2^{k}$.

Thus, there are integers $m_1<m_2<\cdots, <m_{\beta c}$ such that 
$$\forall i, 2^{m_i}\equiv 2^{k}\mod 2^{k}.$$
But then 
$$f(\sum_{i=1}^{\beta c} 2^{m_i}) \equiv \beta c 2^{k} -\beta c \eqquiv -\beta c \mod 2^{k}c.$$
In other words, we can get any multiple of $c$ we want, and we
can have an arbirary number of zeros on the right of this number.

Thus, we can nicely compose $n_1$ with $f(n_1)\equiv a \mod c$
satisfying $f(n_1)\equiv a + \beta c \mod 2^{k}c$ with 
$n_2$ satisfying $f(n_2) \equiv -\beta c \mod 2^{k}c$ and $n_2$
has zeros on all the slots that  $n_1$ would occupy.
Therefore, 
$$f(n_1+n_2)\equiv a \mod 2^{k}c,$$
concluding the proof.
