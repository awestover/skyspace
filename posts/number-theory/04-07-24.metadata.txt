the circle method: warring's problem

The circle method is a quite cool technique in analytic NT. 
Here is an exposition of the circle method for solving the
Warring problem. Much of the analysis follows closely to
Nathanson's book on classical additive bases, although in a few
places I have tried to give simpler proofs of some of the
statements, or otherwise deviated from his presentation to
hopefully add clarity and motivation.
