number theory classical additive bases: chapter 4

A major topic in additive number theory is the following
question: given a set $A\subseteq \N$, can every sufficiently
large positive integer be expressed as the sum of a bounded
number of elements of $A$? If so, in how many ways can number $n$
be represented. 
We say that the set $A$ is an **additive basis** of order $h$ if
every positive integer can be written as the sum of at most $h$
elements from $A$.
