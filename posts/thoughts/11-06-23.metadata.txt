ethics of donating to charity

Is it ethical to spend money on personal luxuries or things you
find meaningful and important when this money could be repurposed
to promote health and even save lives? I'm not totally sure, but
must decide anyways. Alas, such is life. 
Anyways I wrote an essay about the question for my philosophy
class, and by popular demand am posting it here.
Interested to hear people's opinions, to what extent you disagree
or agree, or if you have any other interesting arguments.
