<p>Just finished editing an essay for my philosophy class. As several of the dilligent readers of my blog have expressed interest in this paper I am posting it here.</p>
<p>Before the paper, some remarks are in order:</p>
<div class="rmk envbox">
<p><strong>Remark.</strong> I’m not fully satisfied with how the paper turned out. To some extent this may be the fault of me making a bad argument. But I think there is also some element of this which is an intrinsic unavoidable property of philosophy: the “right answers”, assuming such objects even exist, are fairly slippery and hard to pin down.</p>
<p>There’s some kind of balance. I think a skeptical / non-commital approach to philosophy is <strong>wrong</strong>. We <em>do</em> know some things, we <em>do</em> have some ethical obligations, and so on. Just not asking the questions is <strong>wrong</strong>, as is avoiding logical inevitabilities that make us uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The fact that there are so many dissenting voices in philosophy might make the following approach (which is <strong>bad</strong>) attractive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find some arguments for whatever life style and opinions I currently hold, and use those arguments to justify my way of life.</li>
</ul>
<p>Seems like writing some philisophical appologies is probably a good idea to avoid the “not thinking about things” trap.</p>
<p>Anyways, what’s the point?</p>
<p>I think the important bottom-line principles are:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you know something is wrong don’t do it.</li>
<li>If you’re unsure whether something is right or wrong, you should try to figure out.</li>
<li>Imorallity in the past is no justification for future immorality. And also only worth obsessing about to the point to which it impacts the future.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Anyways here’s some more words:</p>
