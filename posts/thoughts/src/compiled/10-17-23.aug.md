Just finished editing an essay for my philosophy class. 
As several of the dilligent readers of my blog have expressed
interest in this paper I am posting it here. 

Before the paper, some remarks are in order:

<div class="rmk envbox">**Remark.**
I'm not fully satisfied with how the paper turned out. To some
extent this may be the fault of me making a bad argument. But
I think there is also some element of this which is an
intrinsic unavoidable property of philosophy: 
the "right answers", assuming such objects even exist, are
fairly slippery and hard to pin down.

There's some kind of balance. 
I think a skeptical / non-commital approach to philosophy is **wrong**.
We *do* know some things, we *do* have some ethical obligations, and so on.
Just not asking the questions is **wrong**, as is avoiding
logical inevitabilities that make us uncomfortable. 

The fact that there are so many dissenting voices in philosophy
might make the following approach (which is **bad**)
attractive:

- Find some arguments for whatever life style and opinions I
    currently hold, and use those arguments to justify my way of
    life.

Seems like writing some philisophical appologies is probably a
good idea to avoid the "not thinking about things" trap. 

Anyways, what's the point?

I think the important bottom-line principles are:

- If you know something is wrong don't do it.
- If you're unsure whether something is right or wrong, you
    should try to figure out.
- Imorallity in the past is no justification for future
    immorality. And also only worth obsessing about to the point
    to which it impacts the future.

Anyways here's some more words:
