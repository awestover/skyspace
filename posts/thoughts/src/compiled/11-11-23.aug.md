Here is a taxonomy of the skyspace posts from the last year:

- psets & essays from classes
- explanations of cool ideas from some lectures
- some cool questions that I thought of while doing research
- meta "what is the meaning of research & life" posts
- some cute little problems from various books that I read
- some cool problems that I heard from friends
- more philosophy

I'm quite happy with the variety and quantity of posts. 
In total there were 90 posts in 2023 to-date and 10 posts in
2022. The posts were very not evenly spaced out, but this
      is still an average of 2 posts per week, which is a
      remarkable cadence. 
Is there anything I would change?
I kind of wish I had a larger number of high quality posts. 
I think doing more appearences of the characters would be fun as
well.

ok, now what you've actually been waiting for. 

## Top 5 posts of the year

- [hashing](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/thoughts/06-24-23.html): This post is my all-time favorite for sure. I love it because it really helps me make sense of what does research mean. It's easy to say "I do math because I think its fun". But I think its easy to get discouraged, especially if you try something for a couple months and it feels like no progress. The main idea of this post was that the point of research, to me at least, is to be immersed in a cool problem. To the point where, its probably what you talk about whenever you talk to anyone. To the point where you have a lot of cool non-trivial observations a lot of failed attempts. A lot of conjectures. I can't do it justice here, go read the post. 
- [cool parallel algorithm and fun characters](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/cool-algorithms/01-15-23.html): This post is fun because its a cool algorithm and also because of the characters. I really liked writing them. 
- [simply periodic binary functions](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/number-theory/05-29-23.html): I like this one because this is a simple problem that I thought about probably for a week or two (or maybe a month) and fully solved. I think the bijection is rather slick and I just like the number theory involved. The lemma didn't end up being directly useful for my research but I'm glad I saw the problem through anyways. 
- [k-server on a circle](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/cool-algorithms/07-26-23.html): I like this one because I saw a cool problem mentioned in a paper and thought about it and solved it and it was interesting. 
- [train tracks: again, read a paper and actually desribed it](https://awestover.github.io/skyspace/posts/randomized-algorithms/08-04-23.html): I learned a ton from reading this paper and summarizing it here.
