> "Why do we fight?"

This quote is used in at least three epic fantasy novels (albiet
all written by the same author..., but then maybe that's more a
statement about the books I read...).

Brandon Sanderson, Rhythm of War:

>! "Why do we fight, Kal? Why do we keep going?" "I don't know," Kaladin whispered. "I've forgotten." "It's so we can be with each other." "They all die, Tien. Everyone dies." "So they do, don't they?" "That means it doesn't matter," Kaladin said. "None of it matters." "See, that's the wrong way of looking at it." Tien held him tighter. "Since we all go to the same place in the end, the moments we spent with each other are the only things that do matter. The times we helped each other." 

Brandon Sanderson Oathbringer:

>! "The question,' she replied, 'is not whether you will love, hurt, dream, and die. It is what you will love, why you will hurt, when you will dream, and how you will die. This is your choice. You cannot pick the destination, only the path." 

Robert Jordan / Brandon Sanderson, Memory of Light:

>! ok I couldn't really find the "Memory of Light" quote. But
that one is less meaningful to me anyways because I forgot about
all the characters. 

So, what does it mean?
I guess first I can briefly explain in the context of the
characters mentioned above. 

Quote 1:
Kaladin has lost a lot of loved ones to tragedy in very traumatic
ways. He cares deeply for people and blames himself when harm
befalls his friends.

Quote 2:
(I'm kind making this up here. I don't actually remember the
context of the quote but this seems a reasonable made-up context)
Dalinar is trying to be honorable / virtuous. But this set him up
to be taken advantage of by someone. He's reflecting on whether
he wishes he had changed, been less trusting or whatever, and he
decides that he's pretty satisfied with his life. 

ok, but what does this mean to me?
"Why do we fight?" means a couple of things to me I guess.

The basic idea is "Why do persist in doing hard things?".
For example, I might ask after a "drought" of results
in research "Why keep trying on this problem?".
Or maybe the question makes more sense in the context of
set-backs. 
For instance, recently in my research I worked really hard for a
week or two straight on a single problem. I eventually got what I
thought was a really neat solution. And then I found a paper that
seemed to have already proven this same result. (It turns out
that they actually didn't prove the same result. But that's
besides the point).
And then my friend realized that the result would not extend in
the way that I wanted to larger cases.

After trying really hard at something and then failing I think
it's very natural to feel distress over the time spent on it. 
Ah, but that's interesting. Two sentances ago I said something
about failing. 

Tien to Kaladin "You can't fail, if you truly *understand*"

So, what is it that we are supposed to understand?

It's important to understand that we can't determine "results". 
E.g., I can't decide whether I will solve a math problem I'm
thinking about. I can't decide whether or not someone else will
have already solved the problem. I can't decide if a certain
approach will work. 

Now, at this point the "driven" reader might object: 

> Isn't it important to believe that you will succeed when trying
a math problem?

There is some truth to this. It really is true that all the
coolest results I've ever proven have only come when I believe
that I can solve a problem. 

I think that focussing intensely on a problem for a prolonged
interval of time, even when uncomfortable, can be good. 
But I think it's important to not get too tunnel-visioned. 

For instance in this recent result that I was talking about, it
was really important that I read some literature on some adjacent
problems. 

It's important to understand that the point isn't the result. 
Yes, there are some results that sound super cool. 
But, you have to realize, even that is not intrinsic. To see
this, observe that if you gave a lot of statements that sound
super cool to me to someone who can't read math then they
wouldn't think it is so cool. 
But anyways, its important to work on problems that, even if you
never solve the problem, you'll still be glad you worked on it. 

The expenditure of effort. The random weird notation and names
that you make up to describe the problem. The focus that comes
when every single thing that you read you instantly think of
whether and how this could apply to your problem. 

It's important to be ok with being stuck. To be delighted by it
even. It's important to love the problem enough to want to
notice your fake solves. It's important to also be ok when you
back-slide, when something you thought you knew turns out to be
wrong. Often if a lemma turns out to be false its patchable. 

It's important to do zumba. By which I mean: (a) strenuous physical
activity, (b) some kind of social activity, (c) something really
fun. Actually zumba might be a good model for research. 

--- 

So to summarize, the five keys to doing healthy research are:

9. Don't get too tunnel-visioned. Read other stuff and try a
   variety of angles
0. Clarify your success criterion: realize that the value lies in
   seeking truth far more than obtaining it. 
1. Be willing to move on / give a problem a break. 
2. Come up with silly notation 
3. Physical exercise
4. Social exercise
5. Eat some good food
6. Adequate and healthy sleep
7. collaborate. 
8. Tell everyone about your research. 

So, why do we fight?
It is not in search of glory, validation, happiness, not an
attempt to fill a void of self. It is not because the fight
always feels great. We fight because it's epic to.
