<p><em>disclaimer</em>: I’ve decided that I quite enjoy writing “Alek thoughts on”“life”"" blog posts. So, this is one of those, not hard core math.</p>
<p>Lately, I’ve been doing a lot of things that aren’t math. For instance, differential equations (not math), working, reading, “socializing”. I want to write this to better understand what role these things play in life, where I’ve kind of defined the purpose of life to be “creating epic math”.</p>
<p>Here are some thoughts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is usually very <strong>not</strong> benneficial to perceive an activity that you are already comitted to pursuing as being useless. For instance, diffyq: I can acknowledge that I wouldn’t be learning it if I didn’t want to get credit for the class. However, I may as well a) enjoy it, b) do it quickly, c) do it at low-energy times when I wouldn’t be likely to achieve something else super meaningful with the time</p></li>
<li><p>hmm, another thought: there are infinitely many unimportant things to do. they can fill the time you give them. so prioritize <strong>daily</strong> doing the most important things.</p></li>
<li><p>re motivation. there are ofc hackz to increase motivation. I could try more hackz. hackz that are likely to be effective:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>have a good set of goals</li>
<li>talk about the goals and the challenges with everyone</li>
<li>then people can help you refine your goals and keep you accountable (if they care enough to remember)</li>
<li>hmm, I like this idea it seems like a meaningful way to interact with ppl.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li>reading. I really enjoy reading (good books). I would say, of the “forms of relaxation” that I practice, others being : exercise [walk around, bike, rock climbing ], cooking, talking to ppl sometimes, reading is the most <em>dangerous</em>, because my brain feels like I’m accomplishing something when I finish a book, and the context-switching out of reading is really hard. So what’s the up-shot?
<ol type="1">
<li>find times to read when you have a clear time-limit due to external pressures; even setting a timer can help</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>don’t read right before you need to concentrate on something</li>
<li>remember: you have bought the time with a steep price. this is helpful for helping decide not to squander it.</li>
</ol>
