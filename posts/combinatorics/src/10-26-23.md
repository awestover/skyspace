> Shatar: Imagine I had a complete graph and wanted to direct all
the edges so that the number of incoming and outgoing edges to
each vertex is the same.\
> JJ: You better have an odd number of vertices, or else it's not
going to happen.\
> Shatar: ok, Sure. But how many ways could I do it?\
> JJ: $(n-1)!$\
> Shatar: Hey, no spoilers!


# Bijection direction 1: 

- Take a permutation of $n-1$. place the numbers on the vertices
    of your graph, and put the number $0$ on vertex $v_0$.
- Draw an edge if $i\to j$ is shorter walk  $\mod n$ than  $j\to
    i$
- claim: this gets the indegree = outdegree constraint thing to
    happen

# Now the other direction:

- Take a direction of the edges
- Let $A$ be the out neighbors of $v_0$.
- Give the number to $v\in A$ based on how many other  $w\in A$
     $v$ points to 
- do the same thing for the in-neighbors of $v_0$

So its $(n-1)!$

gotta bounce type this better later?
