Imagine you are taking a random walk and you go up with
probability $p$ and down with probability $1-p$ excpet if you are
at the origin then you must go up.

You might ask the following question: in expectation, how long
should it take to get distance $n$ away from the origin. 

It turns out there are three regimes.

1. If $p=\frac{1}{2}+\eps$ for constant $\eps>0$ then you will
   reach  $n$ after about $\frac{n}{\eps}$ steps in expectation
   or something.

2. If $p=\frac{1}{2}$ then you reach $n$ after about $n^{2}$ 
   steps. You can see this by a chernoff bound or by noting that
   $n^{2}-t$ is a martingale

3. If $p=\frac{1}{2}-\eps$
then here is an arguemnt for why it will take about
$(\frac{1+2\eps}{1-2\eps})^n$ steps:

consider walking from some height $h$ either to height $2h$ or
back to $0$. If you have a path going up you can reflect and get
a path going down. 
But that path would have much much higher weight. By exponential
factor.

Let $$\lambda = \frac{1+2\eps}{1-2\eps}>1.$$
Now to get to all the way to $n$ you must do something like
$$\lambda^{1}\lambda^{2}\lambda^{4}\cdots \lambda^{\frac{n}{2}} =\lambda^{n}.$$

Wow thats a lot.
