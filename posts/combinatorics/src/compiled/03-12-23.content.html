<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(n = \sum a_i p^i, m = \sum b_i p^i\)</span> be the base <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> representations of <span class="math inline">\(m,n\)</span>. Then, <span class="math display">\[\binom{n}{m} \equiv \prod \binom{a_i}{b_i}\mod p.\]</span></p>
</div>
The theorem follows immediately by repeated application of the following lemma:
<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> <span class="math display">\[\binom{ap+b}{cp+d} \equiv \binom{a}{c}\binom{b}{d} \mod p\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Without loss of generality we take <span class="math inline">\(a\neq 0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(ap+b&gt;cp+d\)</span>; otherwise the lemma is trivial.</p>
<p>Think of the <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> points as divided into <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> groups of size <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> left over.</p>
<p>One way of choosing <span class="math inline">\(cp+d\)</span> points is to saturate <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> of the groups and then distribute the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> remaining points among the <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> left over points; note that this is only possible if <span class="math inline">\(d\leq b.\)</span> There are <span class="math inline">\(\binom{a}{c}\)</span> ways to choose which groups to saturate, and <span class="math inline">\(\binom{b}{d}\)</span> ways to choose how to fill the left over points.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we have an arrangement that partially fills one of the groups. Now consider the map <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> which creates a new subset by cycling the elements chosen within each group <span class="math inline">\(\mod p\)</span>. Clearly <span class="math inline">\(f^p = id\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f\neq id\)</span> because one of the groups was partially filled. Now <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> canâ€™t possibly have order less than <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, so we have shown that there are <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> subsets in the equivalence class generated by the action of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> on the subset. In other words, the number of subsets which partially fill one of the groups is divisible by <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p>Hence, only the earlier computed term $ $contributes to the binomial coefficient <span class="math inline">\(\mod p.\)</span></p>
