Imagine you had $p$ elevators, which took time $1$ to move
between floors and time $W$ to stop at a floor, and had capacity
$L$. People arrive at times $t_i$ and you want to optimize some
objective function.

To start we take the goal of minimizing the total time that is
required to transport all of the people assuming that they all
arrive at time $0$.

<div class="prop envbox">**Proposition.**
For $p=1,W=0,L=\infty$ there is a simple linear time algorithm to
compute an optimal schedule
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
The best thing to do is to go up, zig-zagging on some levels, and
then at some point just commiting to going to the top of the
elevator and then coming back down.

<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
For $p=1,W\gg 1,L=\infty$ the problem reduces to computing
"minimum feedback vertex set" i.e. a minimal set of vertices
whose removal leaves a cycle-free graph.
Unfortunately this problem is NP-hard, even to get a constant
approximation to.
However, for our application we can still do a $2$-approximation
to the best elevator schedule by just visiting each node in the
SCCs twice.
Alteranteively we can get an exact solution in time $n^2 2^n.$
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
Compute strongly connected components.
We will have some set of vertices that we need to visit twice
within each connected component. If we leave out these vertices
it should be possible to just visit each of the remaining
vertices once.

What's next?
I think trying $\ell_1$-norm as an objective function, also known
as mean response time, would be a next good step. Another good
step would be realizing teleportation in the physical world.


**update**
Here is a $2$-approx for $\ell_1$-norm:
Let the number of people on the floors be $c_1\geq c_2\geq
\cdots.$
*Strategy*: pick up the floor that has the most people on it,
then drop that off. repeat!
*performance:* $\sum c_j 2j$ worst case.

How good is this?

*Lower bound for OPT:* $\sum c_j (1+j)$

So we are definitely $2$ competitive.
