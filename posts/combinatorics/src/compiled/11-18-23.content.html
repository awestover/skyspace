<p>I was talking to Peter about the following problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What is the largest possible size of a set <span class="math inline">\(X\subset [n]\)</span> where any quadruple <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c,d\in X^4\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a+b=c+d\)</span> is just a trivial quadruple, i.e., <span class="math inline">\(\{a,b\} = \{c,d\}\)</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using the probabilistic method and alterations I think you get <span class="math inline">\(n^{\frac{1}{3}}/100\)</span>. In particular, include each element with probability <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{100 n^{\frac{2}{3}}}\)</span>. Then the expected number of bad quadruples <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c,d\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{100^{4} n^{\frac{8}{3}}}\cdot n^{3} = n^{\frac{1}{3}}/100^{4}\)</span>. So you can probably wholesale kill all the bad quadruples and you aren’t really losing that much by way of density.</p>
<p>But for various reasons I wanted a constructive (i.e., non-randomized) algorithm for constructing such a set.</p>
<p>Peter had this idea: Let <span class="math inline">\(n=4p^{2}\)</span> for some prime <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. Take your set to be <span class="math inline">\(\{2px + (x^2 \mod p)\mid x\in [p]\}\)</span>. So, this has density <span class="math inline">\(\Omega(\sqrt{n})\)</span> which is impossible to beat and its determinstic. Dang nice!</p>
<p><strong>Claim</strong>: this is free of the pattern we want to avoid</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[2px+(x^2 \mod p) + 2py + (y^2 \mod p) = 2pz+(z^2 \mod p) + 2pw + (w^2 \mod p)\]</span> basically by construction means</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[x^2+y^2 \equiv z^2+w^2 \mod p\]</span> <span class="math display">\[x+y \equiv z+w \mod p\]</span></p>
<p>So, <span class="math display">\[x^2+(z+w-x)^2 \equiv z^2+w^2 \mod p\]</span> <span class="math display">\[x^2+(z+w)^2-2x(z+w)+x^2 \equiv z^2+w^2 \mod p\]</span> <span class="math display">\[2x^2+z^2+2zw+w^2-2x(z+w) \equiv z^2+w^2 \mod p\]</span> <span class="math display">\[x^2 \equiv x(z+w)-zw \mod p\]</span></p>
<p>This is a quadratic in <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> over a field. So it has two solutions. And basically what’s going to happen is we get one solution <span class="math inline">\(x_0\)</span> which gives <span class="math inline">\(y_0=z+w-x_0\)</span> so we have <span class="math inline">\((x_0,y_0)\)</span> and then its going to turn out that <span class="math inline">\(y_0,x_0\)</span> is also a solution (obviously).</p>
<p>Anyways, we find that the set is free of the pattern as desired.</p>
