<p>this is yet again, #problemfromthebook. I’ve taken a tiny break from the NT and am doing some combo stuff. Today pidgeon.</p>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> There are infinitely many <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> so that <span class="math display">\[f(x,y)=\left\lfloor x^{\frac{3}{2}} \right\rfloor+\left\lfloor y^{\frac{3}{2}} \right\rfloor=A\]</span> has at least <span class="math inline">\(100\)</span> lattice solutions <span class="math inline">\((x,y)\in \mathbb{N}^{2}\)</span>.</p>

<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong></p>
<p>Let’s say that all the <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>’s we’ve found thus-far are of size at most <span class="math inline">\(M-1\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(M\in \mathbb{N}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, consider the values <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)\)</span> can take on in a <span class="math inline">\(M^2\)</span>-side-length square starting at <span class="math inline">\((M,M)\)</span> : clearly it can take on at most <span class="math display">\[2(M+M^{2})^{\frac{3}{2}} \le 8 M^3\]</span> unique values. But there are <span class="math inline">\(M^4\)</span> lattice points in the square. So there is some value of <span class="math inline">\(f(x,y)\)</span> which occurs at least <span class="math inline">\(\frac{M}{8}\)</span> times in the square.</p>
