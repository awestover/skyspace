# max min probability
Let $X_1,X_2,X_3$ be random variables. Find
$$\max \min \{\Pr[X_1>X_2], \Pr[X_2>X_3], \Pr[X_3 > X_1]\}$$

<div class="clm envbox">**Claim.**
The maximal value is $2/3$.

Let $Y_{ij}$ denote the indicator random variable for $X_i>X_j$. 
Clearly $Y_{12}+Y_{23}+Y_{31} \leq 2$ so $\E[\sum Y_{i, i+1}]\leq
2$. This means that $\max\min \E[Y_{i,i+1}] \leq 2/3$. Of course
$\E[Y_{ij}] = \Pr[X_i > X_j]$, so we cannot do better than $2/3$.

We can achieve $2/3$ as follows:

 - With probability $1/3$, $X_1<X_3<X_2$
 - With probability $1/3$, $X_3<X_3<X_1$
 - With probability $1/3$, $X_2<X_1<X_3$.

# coin flip sum parity
<div class="clm envbox">**Claim.**
Let $X_i$ be independent Bernouli's. Claim: the sum has odd
parity with probability $1/2$ iff one of the $X_i$'s has odd
parity with probability $1/2$.

Clearly if one of random variables, say $X_n$, has an equal
chance of being either parity, then the sum has equal chance of
having either parity: the sum has some distribution before the
addition of $X_n$, and then adding $X_n$ makes the parity even or
odd with equal probability.

To show that one of the random variables must have $p_i=1/2$ for
the parity to be equally likely odd or even, we proceed by
induction.
Consider r.v.s that have odd parity with probability $p_1,p_2$.
For the parity of the sum to be equally likely odd or even we
must have 
$$p_1p_2 + \bar{p_1}\bar{p_2} = p_1\bar{p_2} + \bar{p_1}p_2.$$
But this implies
$$p_1(p_2 - \bar{p_2}) = \bar{p_1} (p_2 - \bar{p_2}).$$
In other words, either $p_1 = \bar{p_1}$ or $p_2 = \bar{p_2}$.
Therefore we inductively find that adding independent random
variables whose parity is not equally likely to be odd or even
can never result in a random variable with equal probability of
being even or odd.

# weights
<div class="clm envbox">**Claim.**
You have weights $2^0,2^1, \ldots, 2^{n-1}$. You put them on a
scale in some order such that the right pan of the scale is never
heavier than the left. How many ways can this be done?
</div>

<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**

Let $f(n)$ denote the number of valid ways to place the weights.
Say that the $i$-th weight placed is of weight $2^0$. If $i=1$
then the weight must be left pan or the right pan would be
heavier. After placing this weight on the left pan though, we
would be in essentially the same position but with $n-1$ instead
of $n$, because $2^0$ is so small compared to all the other
weights that it can never affect which way the scales tip in the
future, i.e. at any future state the scale will tip the same way
even if we ignore the $2^0$ weight.
On the other hand, if we place the $2^0$ weight at some position
$1<i\leq n$, then we can place it on the right or the left scale:
either way is fine. In this situation it suffices to compute a
method for placing the $2^1,\ldots, 2^n$ weights, and then we can
just insert this new weight.

Thus we derive the recurrence: 
$$f(n) = (2(n-1)+1)f(n-1) = (2n-1)f(n-1).$$
We have as the base case $f(0) = f(1) = 1$. 
We remark that $f(n)$ is sometimes called the "double
factorial" written $n!!$.
