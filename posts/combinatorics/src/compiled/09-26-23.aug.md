Imagine you are taking a random walk and you go up with
probability $p$ and down with probability $1-p$ excpet if you are
at the origin then you must go up.

You might ask the following question: in expectation, how long
should it take to get distance $n$ away from the origin. 

It turns out there are three regimes.

1. If $p=\frac{1}{2}+\eps$ for constant $\eps>0$ then you will
   reach  $n$ after about $\frac{n}{\eps}$ steps in expectation
   or something.

2. If $p=\frac{1}{2}$ then you reach $n$ after about $n^{2}$ 
   steps. You can see this by a chernoff bound or by noting that
   $n^{2}-t$ is a martingale

3. If $p=\frac{1}{2}-\eps$
then here is an arguemnt for why it will take about
$(\frac{1+2\eps}{1-2\eps})^n$ steps:

consider walking from some height $h$ either to height $2h$ or
back to $0$. If you have a path going up you can reflect and get
a path going down. 
But that path would have much much higher weight. By exponential
factor.

Let $$\lambda = \frac{1+2\eps}{1-2\eps}>1.$$
Now to get to all the way to $n$ you must do something like
$$\lambda^{1}\lambda^{2}\lambda^{4}\cdots \lambda^{\frac{n}{2}} =\lambda^{n}.$$

Wow thats a lot.

Don't believe it? see for yourself!

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

p = 0.45
def val(n):
    A = np.array([[0.0 for i in range(n+1)] for j in range(n+1)])
    b = np.array([1.0 for i in range(n+1)])
    b[n] = 0

    A[0][0] = 1
    A[0][1] = -1

    for i in range(1,n):
        A[i][i] = 1
        A[i][i-1] = -(1-p)
        A[i][i+1] = -p

    A[n][n] = 1

    F = np.linalg.solve(A,b)

    return F[0]

NS = range(2,100)
vals = [val(n) for n in NS]
eps = 1/2 -p
bob = (1+2*eps)/(1-2*eps)
points = [bob**(1.1*n) for n in NS]
plt.plot(vals)
plt.plot(points)
plt.show()

```
