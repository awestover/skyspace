<p>A very famous result is that if <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\in S_3\)</span> is any <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span>-letter permutation, then the number of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-letter permutations which avoid <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is counted by the catalan numbers <span class="math inline">\(C_n\)</span>, which is pretty cool!</p>
<p>Here’s a proof for <span class="math inline">\(\sigma=231\)</span> (you can check the other <span class="math inline">\(5\)</span> cases yourself, at least one is immediate by symmetry)</p>
<p>So here’s the proof: Let <span class="math inline">\(\pi\in S_n\)</span> be a <span class="math inline">\(231\)</span>-avoiding permutation. Then, the corresponding Dyck path will return to height <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> for the first time after exactly <span class="math inline">\(2\pi_1\)</span> steps. Now you recursively find the segment before the return, and recursively find the segment after the return.</p>

<p>Basically, the key to note is that after you fix <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1\)</span> then you have to deal with everything less than <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1\)</span> before dealing with anything larger than <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1\)</span>, because once you leave the below <span class="math inline">\(\pi_1\)</span> teritory, you can’t return. ever.</p>
