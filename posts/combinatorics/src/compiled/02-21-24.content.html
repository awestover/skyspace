<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> There are <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon\)</span>-complete sets of size approx <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon^{-1}\log^2 n\)</span>.</p>

First need key lemma. Theorem follows immediately from lemma.
<div class="lem envbox">
<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> Fix <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon&gt;0, n\in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. There is a set of <span class="math inline">\(\varepsilon^{-1}\log n\)</span> many integers whose set of subsets contains an interval of size <span class="math inline">\(n\log n\)</span> and starts at <span class="math inline">\(n/2\)</span> or something.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Here we highlight the general technique that seems to be powering a lot of their results.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Randomly sample numbers with no prime divisors smaller than <span class="math inline">\((\log n)/2\)</span> (iirc)</li>
<li>For the first little while, whenever you add a number it is quite likely to double the interval of attainable sums.</li>
<li>Then once your interval is rather large and you’ve drawn a bunch of elements you can extend the interval by the size of the drawn elements each time.</li>

<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> We say a coloring of <span class="math inline">\([n]\)</span> is good if there is no monochromatic set of integers summing to <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</p>
<p>I ignore log factors in following statement.</p>
<p>You need about <span class="math inline">\(n^{1/3}\)</span> colors to be good. There exists a good coloring using <span class="math inline">\(n^{1/3}\)</span> colors.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong></p>
<p>We split our colors up into several types:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>big elements</li>
<li>multiples of primes not dividing <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span></li>
<li>everything else, grouped into groups with sums smaller than <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>It turns out that after handling 1,2 there is not so much stuff left for 3, and what’s left is pretty small. So this ends up being a pretty efficient coloring.</p>

</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Here is a 2-coloring that demonstrates the set is not 2-complete. Color powers of <span class="math inline">\(p^{i}\)</span> Red. Color everything else Blue.

<div class="prop envbox">
<p><strong>Proposition.</strong> The set <span class="math inline">\(1,2,4,\ldots, 2^{k-1}\)</span> has the property that all of its subset sums are distinct.</p>
</div>
<div class="thm envbox">
<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(a_1&lt;a_2&lt;\cdots &lt;a_k\)</span> be positive integers such that all subset sums of <span class="math inline">\(\left\{ a_i\right\}\)</span> are distinct. Then <span class="math inline">\(a_k \ge 2^{k}/\sqrt{k}\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong></p>
<p>First we give an easy argument to show <span class="math inline">\(a_k \ge 2^{k}/k\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(a_k&lt;2^{k}/k\)</span> then all subset sums would be contained in <span class="math inline">\([2^{k}-1]\)</span>. But there are <span class="math inline">\(2^{k}\)</span> subset sums so they could then not all be distinct.</p>
<p>To prove <span class="math inline">\(2^{k}/\sqrt{k}\)</span> we use second moment method. If you take a random sum it is tightly concentrated.</p>
<p><strong>TODO3: figure this out more</strong></p>
<p>Fox talked about how they did something fancy isoperimetric inequality boolean cube to get a better constant.</p>
<p><strong>TODO4: upper or lower bounds is a kind of fun openq to think about</strong></p>
