Say that $X\sim Binomial(n,p)$. The Chernoff Bound that I like to use
states:  $\forall \delta\in (0,1)$,
$$\Pr[X>(1+\delta)np]\leq exp(-np \frac{\delta^2}{3}).$$
This is great. But today I faced the following situation:
$p=\frac{1}{n}$, and I wanted to figure out the largest $\delta$
such that this bound is still "high probability".
I, trusting in my Chernoff bound went and plugged in some large values of $\delta$ to see what happens.
You may have already realized my mistake. The above formula is
only valid for $\delta < 1$.

In general, the formula is really this: $\forall \delta > 0,$
$$\Pr[X>(1+\delta)np]\leq exp(-np \frac{\delta^2}{\delta+2}).$$
 Ah, now it becomes clear what was wrong with what I was doing
 above.

 Anyways, if you use the correct formula you find that $X$ with
 high probability is at most $\log n$. This is actually correct.
 Good.
