<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> In any finite coloring of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^2\)</span> there is a monochromatic axis aligned rectangle.</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Let <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be the number of colors.</p>
<p>Consider the band <span class="math inline">\([t+1] \times \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. In each row of the band we must have two points of the same color, a “monochromatic line segment”. We can identify the monochromatic line segments by their location, for which there are <span class="math inline">\(\binom{t+1}{2}\)</span> options, and it’s color, of which there are <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> options.</p>
<p>Thus, if we look at <span class="math inline">\((t+1)t^2 / 2 + 1\)</span> rows of the band we will find two that have the same color and location. This is a monochromatic axis aligned rectangle.</p>
