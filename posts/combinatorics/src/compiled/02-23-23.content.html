<p>Say that <span class="math inline">\(X\sim Binomial(n,p)\)</span>. The Chernoff Bound that I like to use states: <span class="math inline">\(\forall \delta\in (0,1)\)</span>, <span class="math display">\[\Pr[X&gt;(1+\delta)np]\leq exp(-np \frac{\delta^2}{3}).\]</span> This is great. But today I faced the following situation: <span class="math inline">\(p=\frac{1}{n}\)</span>, and I wanted to figure out the largest <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> such that this bound is still “high probability”. I, trusting in my Chernoff bound went and plugged in some large values of <span class="math inline">\(\delta\)</span> to see what happens. You may have already realized my mistake. The above formula is only valid for <span class="math inline">\(\delta &lt; 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>In general, the formula is really this: <span class="math inline">\(\forall \delta &gt; 0,\)</span> <span class="math display">\[\Pr[X&gt;(1+\delta)np]\leq exp(-np \frac{\delta^2}{\delta+2}).\]</span> Ah, now it becomes clear what was wrong with what I was doing above.</p>
<p>Anyways, if you use the correct formula you find that <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> with high probability is at most <span class="math inline">\(\log n\)</span>. This is actually correct. Good.</p>
