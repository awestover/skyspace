<p>More than <span class="math inline">\(1-\frac{1}{n}\)</span> of the circumference of a circle is colored black. Can you draw a regular <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gon on the circle with all vertices in black regions?</p>
<p>this is yet again problem from the book.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>solve assuming the black area is in finitely many disjoint intervals</li>
<li>solve assuming the axiom of choice and not assuming anything beyond the measure of the set of black points being larger than <span class="math inline">\(1-\frac{1}{n}\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>um. I’m going to pretend like I didn’t think up question 2. but I’m kind of curious. could it really be different? anyways, here’s my solve for question 1:</p>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Imagine a discrete version of the problem. It is trivial.</p>
<p>Now, if we discrete the original problem correctly we get this trivial discretized version.</p>
</div>
