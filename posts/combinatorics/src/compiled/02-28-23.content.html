<p>Consider a <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-coloring of <span class="math inline">\([k]^d\)</span> (i.e. a <span class="math inline">\(k\times k \times k \cdots\)</span> cube). For instance, if <span class="math inline">\(k=3,d=2,t=2\)</span> and our colors are “X” and “O” then this corresponds to placing X’s and O’s in a <span class="math inline">\(3 \times 3\)</span> grid. A “monochromatic combinatorial line” in <span class="math inline">\([k]^d\)</span> is generated by a string that looks kind of like <span class="math inline">\(1*4**2*5\)</span>. In particular, this string is encoding a size <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> subset of <span class="math inline">\([k]^d\)</span>. For instance in tick-tack-toe, <span class="math inline">\(1*\)</span> would correspond to the set <span class="math inline">\(\{11,12,13\}\)</span> i.e. a line in the first row of the tick tack toe board. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(**\)</span> would correspond to the diagonal <span class="math inline">\(\{11,22,33\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We all know tick-tack-toe can end in a tie, although I bet I can still beat you more often then not.</p>
<p>However, an interesting question is, if you played really high dimensional tick tack toe would it still be possible to end in a tie? It turns out, the answer is <strong>no</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> For any <span class="math inline">\(t,k\)</span>, there exists <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> sufficiently large so that any <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-coloring of <span class="math inline">\([k]^d\)</span> must contain a monochromatic combinatorial line.</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> We proceed by induction on <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>. Assume that we have proved the statement for <span class="math inline">\(k-1\)</span> and all <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Now we aim to establish it for <span class="math inline">\(k, t_0\)</span>, for some fixed <span class="math inline">\(t_0.\)</span> We do so by the following lemma:</p>
<p>begin lem There is a <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\([k]^d\)</span> either just has a monochromatic combinatorial line, or it has <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> combinatorial lines that are monochromatic besides their endpoints, and these lines all share an endpoint and all have distinct colors. end lem begin pf We take <span class="math inline">\(d&#39;\)</span> large enough that the lemma holds for <span class="math inline">\(j-1\)</span>. We take <span class="math inline">\(d&#39;&#39;\)</span> large enough that <span class="math inline">\(t^{k^{n&#39;}}\)</span>-colorings of <span class="math inline">\([k-1]^{d&#39;&#39;}\)</span> have monochromatic combinatorial lines. We claim that <span class="math inline">\(d=d&#39;+d&#39;&#39;\)</span> is large enough to establish the lemma for <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>. Here is a proof by picture:</p>

<p>We use the lemma until we supposedly get <span class="math inline">\(t_0\)</span> lines each of distinct color with common endpoint. One of them has to have color the same as the endpoint. So we just win.</p>
