<div class="thm envbox">**Theorem.**
In any finite coloring of $\Z^2$ there is a monochromatic axis
aligned rectangle.
</div>

<div class="pf envbox">**Proof.**
Let $t$ be the number of colors. 

Consider the band $[t+1] \times \Z$. 
In each row of the band we must have two points of the same
color, a "monochromatic line segment". 
We can identify the monochromatic line segments by their
location, for which there are  $\binom{t+1}{2}$ options, and it's
color, of which there are  $t$ options.

Thus, if we look at  $(t+1)t^2 / 2 + 1$ rows of the band we will
find two that have the same color and location. 
This is a monochromatic axis aligned rectangle.
