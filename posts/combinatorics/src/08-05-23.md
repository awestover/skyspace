cute bijection between graph and anti-graph

Consider the following two methods for generating a random graph:
1. start from an empty graph. randomly add edges until you form a
   triangle. undo the final added edge, and then halt.
2. start from the complete graph. randomly delete edges until you
   become triangle free and then halt.

Now, a priori these kind of seem like different things. 
It turns out they generate the same graphs with the same
probabilities.

rather than thinking  about choosing edges one at a time just
number them all up front. then, you can think about going
forwards or backwards in a list of all the edges.
there is a unique threshold thing when you go from triangle free
to having triangles. the two different methods meet in this
middle point.
