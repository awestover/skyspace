Showing that an equation has many lattice solutions

this is yet again, #problemfromthebook.
I've taken a tiny break from the NT and am doing some combo
stuff. Today pidgeon.

beg thm
There are infinitely many $A$ so that
$$f(x,y)=\floor{x^{\frac{3}{2}}}+\floor{y^{\frac{3}{2}}}=A$$ 
has at least
$100$ lattice solutions $(x,y)\in \N^{2}$.
end thm
beg pf

Let's say that all the $A$'s we've found thus-far are of size at
most $M-1$ for some $M\in \N$.

Now, consider the values $f(x,y)$ can take on in a
$M^2$-side-length square starting at  $(M,M)$ :
clearly it can take on at most 
$$2(M+M^{2})^{\frac{3}{2}} \le 8 M^3$$
unique values.
But there are $M^4$ lattice points in the square. 
So there is some value of $f(x,y)$ which occurs at least  $\frac{M}{8}$ times in the square. 


end pf
