prefix sum of binomial coefficients
{contents}

{description}
Binomial coefficients come up all over the place in
combinatorics. This article gives a decent bound on the sum of a
prefix of binomial coefficients. The bound get's pretty tight
for like $(.1n, .5n)$, but if you can find something
tighter, please let me know!

We aim to bound
$$\sum_{i\leq \epsilon n} \binom{n}{i}$$

The answer, roughly speaking, should be $c(\epsilon)^n$ for some
$1 \leq c(\epsilon) \leq 2$.

We can think of this probabilistically as being related to the
following problem:
Let $X_1,\ldots, X_n$ be independent random variables with
probabilty $1/2$ of occuring. These random variables represent
taking a subset of $[n]$.
Then we are concerned with 
$$\Pr[\sum X_i \leq \epsilon n].$$

In particular, 
$$\Pr[\sum X_i \leq \epsilon n] = 2^{-n} \sum_{i\leq \epsilon
n}\binom{n}{i}.$$

Applying one form of the Chernoff bound listed on wikipedia 
we can bound our sum by

$$\Pr[\sum X_i \leq \epsilon n] \leq
\left(\frac{2}{\sqrt{e}}\left(\frac{e}{2\epsilon}\right)^\epsilon\right)^n.$$

This is basically tight for $\epsilon \approx 1/2$, and pretty
decent for e.g. $\epsilon\in (.1,.5)$.
