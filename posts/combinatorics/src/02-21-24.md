Jacob Foxs gave a nice talk about subset sums today. I summarize
what I remember from it.

# 1. complete sets

beg defn
A set $S$ is $r$-complete if, for any $r$-coloring of $S$ there
is a monochromatic set of numbers in $S$ summing to all
sufficiently large values.
end defn

beg defn
A set is $\eps$-complete if, for any subset $S'$ of $S$ with size at
least $\eps|S|$ there is a subet of $S'$ summing to all
sufficiently large values.
end defn

beg thm
There are $\eps$-complete sets of size approx $\eps^{-1}\log^2
n$.
end thm

First need key lemma. Theorem follows immediately from lemma.
beg lem
Fix $\eps>0, n\in \N$.
There is a set of $\eps^{-1}\log n$ many integers whose set of
subsets contains an interval of size $n\log n$ and starts at $n/2$ or something.
end lem
beg pf
Here we highlight the general technique that seems to be powering
a lot of their results.

1. Randomly sample numbers with no prime divisors smaller than $(\log n)/2$ (iirc)
2. For the first little while, whenever you add a number it is
   quite likely to double the interval of attainable sums.
3. Then once your interval is rather large and you've drawn a
   bunch of elements you can extend the interval by the size of
   the drawn elements each time.

**TODO: figure out details?**

end pf

Proof of theorem from lemma:
beg pf
Dyadically apply the lemma
end pf

beg thm
There are no $\epsilon$-complete sets of size smaller than
$\log^2 n$
end thm


# 2. avoiding a specific sum

beg thm
We say a coloring of $[n]$ is good if there is no monochromatic
set of integers summing to  $n$.

I ignore log factors in following statement.

You need about $n^{1/3}$ colors to be good.
There exists a good coloring using $n^{1/3}$ colors.
end thm
beg pf

We split our colors up into several types:

1. big elements
2. multiples of primes not dividing $n$
3. everything else, grouped into groups with sums smaller than $n$.

It turns out that after handling 1,2 there is not so much stuff
left for 3, and what's left is pretty small. So this ends up
being a pretty efficient coloring.

end pf

# 3. $r$-complete sets

beg prop
$\set{p^{i}q^{j}}$ is not $2$-complete, but it is $1$-complete.
end prop
beg pf
Here is a 2-coloring that demonstrates the set is not 2-complete. 
Color powers of $p^{i}$ Red. Color everything else Blue.
Then all Blue numbers are multiples of $q$. So both blue and red
and severely limited in the numbers they can achieve.

**TODO1: prove it  is 1-complete**
end pf

beg rmk
As far as I know it is not known whether $\set{p^{i}q^{j}r^{k}}$ is $2$-complete or not.

**TODO2: solve**
end rmk

# 4. subset-sum free set

beg prop
The set $1,2,4,\ldots, 2^{k-1}$ has the property that all of its
subset sums are distinct.
end prop

beg thm
Let $a_1<a_2<\cdots <a_k$ be positive integers such that
all subset sums of $\set{a_i}$ are distinct.
Then $a_k \ge 2^{k}/\sqrt{k}$.
end thm
beg pf

First we give an easy argument to show $a_k \ge 2^{k}/k$.
If $a_k<2^{k}/k$ then all subset sums would be contained in $[2^{k}-1]$.
But there are $2^{k}$ subset sums so they could then not all be
distinct.

To prove $2^{k}/\sqrt{k}$ we use second moment method.
If you take a random sum it is tightly concentrated.

**TODO3: figure this out more**

Fox talked about how they did something fancy isoperimetric
inequality boolean cube to get a better constant.

**TODO4: upper or lower bounds is a kind of fun openq to think about**

end pf
