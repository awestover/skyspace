how many edges to guarantee ham-cycle?
{contents}

{description}
A common question in extremal graph theory is "what conditions do
I have to put on my graph to get property X"
In this blog post, we investigate the question: 
how many edges to guarantee hamiltonian-cycle?

beg defn 
**ham cycle**: a cycle consisting of all the vertices.
end defn

beg prop
There is a graph on $n$ vertices with $\binom{n-1}{2}+1$ edges that does not contain a ham-cycle
end prop
beg pf
$n-1$-clique adjoin a vertex with a single edge to the clique. 
end pf

beg thm
Any graph on $n$ vertices with at least $\binom{n-1}{2}+2$ edges
contains a ham-cycle.
end thm
beg pf
If the graph is $K_n$ we are done. Assume the graph is not $K_n$.
Let $v_0$ be the minimal degree vertex.
We have $\deg(v_0)\ge 2, \deg(v_0)\le n-2$.

We consider two cases:
- **Case 1**: $G[V\setminus v_0]$ has at least $\binom{n-2}{2}+2$
    edges. 
    Then we are done by recursion, and splicing  $v_0$ into whatever
    cycle we find in $G[V\setminus v_0]$.
- **Case 2**: $G[V\setminus v_0]$ has at most $\binom{n-2}{2}+1$ 
  edges.
  Actually, this is impossible, because it would imply that
  $$\deg(v_0) \ge \binom{n-1}{2}-\binom{n-2}{2}+1 = n-1,$$
  but we assumed that $G\neq K_n$.
