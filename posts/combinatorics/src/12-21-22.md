begin prop
  In the decide on arrival model, no deterministic on-line
  algorithm has competitive ratio better than $2$.
end prop

  Imagine we get tasks in the following order: 
  $$(2,p), (4,2p), (8,4p), (8, 8p)\times p-3.$$
  Clearly OPT can handle this in time $8$.
  If the algorithm decides any of the first $3$ tasks $\ser$
  ever, then we don't give the rest of the tasks and the
  algorithm has ratio $2$. 
  On the other hand, if the algorithm did the first $3$ tasks all
  in $\pll$, then the total time is going to be approximately
  $1+2+4+8 \approx 8\cdot 2$. This demonstrates the lower bound.
