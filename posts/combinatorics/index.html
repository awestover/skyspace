<p> I read a cool paper [Bilò, Davide, et al. “Cutting Bamboo Down to Size.” arXiv preprint arXiv:2005.00168 (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.00168) and wrote a little "summary" of it. | very chill and very awesome!

<p>I am going to try to read "The Probablistic Method" by Noga Alon and Joel H.
Spencer. The Probablistic Method, pioneered by Erdos, is a really interesting
way to think about combinatorics problems. Here is a high level overview of how
proofs by the probabilistic method go
