<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> <span class="math inline">\(n^{7/3}\)</span> APSP +2 approx</p>
</div>
<div class="pf envbox">
<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Split into three types of vertices: high: <span class="math inline">\(\deg v &gt; H\)</span> medium: <span class="math inline">\(\deg v \in [L, H]\)</span>, low: <span class="math inline">\(\deg v &lt; L\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Case 1</strong>: the shortest <span class="math inline">\(u,v\)</span> path contains a high degree vertex. We capture an approx for these guys as follows: Sample <span class="math inline">\(100 n/H \log n\)</span> vertices, call the sample <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span>. WHP <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span> contains a neighbor of <em>every</em> high degree vertex. BFS out of all the vertices in <span class="math inline">\(S_1\)</span> to compute <span class="math inline">\(d(h, v)\)</span> for each <span class="math inline">\(h\in S_1, v\in V\)</span>. Then itterate over <span class="math inline">\(u,v\in V^2, h\in S_1\)</span> and set <span class="math display">\[d(u,v)\le \min_{h\in S_1} d(u,h) + d(h,v).\]</span> This gives a <span class="math inline">\(+2\)</span> approx for Case 1 pairs.</p>
<p><strong>Case 2</strong>: the shortest <span class="math inline">\(u,v\)</span> path contains a medium degree vertex. Sample <span class="math inline">\(100n/L \log n\)</span> vertices. Call this <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span>. Do a BFS out of each vertex in <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span>, this costs <span class="math inline">\(nH \cdot n/L\)</span>. Now we can’t just do what we did in Case 1: it’d be too slow.</p>
<p>Instead, we create a new graph which should hopefully have max-degree <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> but not throw away the info we just got from <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>First, delete all edges between vertices in <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span> and between all vertices of middle degree. I.e., we only keep edges with one endpoint being a low degree vertex and edges that have one endpoint in <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span> and one endpoint out of <span class="math inline">\(S_2\)</span>. The number of edges in the resulting graph is at most <span class="math inline">\(nL + nH/L\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now, itterate over each vertex <span class="math inline">\(u\in V\)</span>: we will run a fancy SSSP from <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. First, we take the above graph and we add edges from <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to each vertex <span class="math inline">\(x\in S_{2}\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(d(x, u)\)</span> (when I say edge of length <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> I really mean a path of lenght <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> because we are doing unweighted APSP). Then BFS out of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. The cost of this BFS is the number of edges in the graph which is <span class="math inline">\(nL + nH/L\)</span>.</p>
<p>We claim that this BFS gives a 2-approx to the shortest paths out of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> (except for the <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> for which <span class="math inline">\((u,v)\)</span> was already handled in case 1).</p>
<p>To see this, first note that all <span class="math inline">\((u,v)\)</span> paths consisting solely of low degree vertices survive in the modified graph.</p>
<p>Next, observe that if the shortest <span class="math inline">\((u,v)\)</span> is a path of case 2, i.e., has a medium degree vertex on it, then taking the shortcut from <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to the final medium degree vertex on this shortest <span class="math inline">\(u,v\)</span> path and then following low degree edges gets us to <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. Hence we can also find this sort of path.</p>
<p>Run time over all is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ n^{3}/H + n^2H/L + n^2L \le O(n^{7/3}) \]</span> by setting <span class="math inline">\(H=n^{2/3},L= n^{1/3}\)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Remark.</strong> This is not the best known APSP approx. You can do a bit better with MM.</p>
<p>Also, if you are looking for a 2x approx instead of +2 approx you can also do better.</p>
