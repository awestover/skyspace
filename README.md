| Topic | Description | Intensity |
|---|---|---|
| [Probabistic Method](probabilistic_method) | Lots of neat combinatorics. Follows the book "The Probabilistic Method" by Noga Alon and Joel Spencer, which details an elegant perspective on combinatorics problems initiated by Erdos. | Need some basic combinatorics. I'll try to define the new combinatorial objects I come across though. |
| [Funtional Analysis](functional_analysis) | Build up to, and proof of Projection Theorem. Might also talk about general Banach spaces but probably mostly Hilbert spaces. | Technically no prereqs, but it'll be easier to follow if you've had an introductory college course in Linear Algebra and Real Analysis ;) |
| [Introduction To Linear Algebra](intro_to_linear_algebra) | An introduction to linear algebra. It will be a pretty different introduction than you are likely to get elsewise (AFAIK). I hope it will be a good one. | light intensity |
| [Fast Integer Multiplication](fastIntegerMultiplication) | Do you feel like you're not fast enough at math? What if there were a provably faster way to do almost every computation (up to constants)? Nearly every computation that you ever do relies on multiplication (sorry if this offends anyone). In this blog post I show how to multiply together two n-digit numbers not in time $O(n^2)$, like you've been doing your whole life till now, but in time $O(n \log n)$ using the Fast Fourier Transform. Wow!!  *terms and conditions may apply | You need to know what complex numbers are, some linear algebra is probably useful. It's not a self contained introduction to digital signal processing, you an see [Digital Signal Processing](digitalSignalProcessing/digitalSignalProcessing.pdf) for an introduction to digital signal processing. But technically you don't need to know any DSP to understand the article, because I define a fourier transform.|
| [Randomized Algorithms](randomizedAlgorithms) | An introduction to how to analyze a specific type of randomized algorithm. There is a lot of introductory probability in here. | Knowing a bit of probability would probably be helpful |
| [Cache Behavior](cacheBehavior) | An introduction to the performance benefits that cache behavior can bring to a program. | I assume you can read simple code, and that you know what a matrix / 2d array is|
| [Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus/fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus.pdf) | introduce basic notions in calculus, prove fundamental theorem of calculus (incredibly rigorously with a ton of analysis)| Technically no preqeqs, but it'll be a bit cooler if you know calculus|
| [Digital Signal Processing](digitalSignalProcessing/digitalSignalProcessing.pdf) | what are signals? Fourier transform, convolutions, LTIs.| should know some linear algebra |
| [Measure Theory](measureTheory) | Read this if you are interested in any of the following questions: "what is a meausre space?", "what's a set in $\mathbb{R}$" that has no well defined inner-measure? / why do measure spaces need $\sigma$-Algebra's defined on them?", "what's a Lesbegue integral?", "what's Lesbegue's dominated convergence theorem?" (_note: work in progress_) | I probably assume some real analysis background |
| [Cryptography](cryptography/) | crypto history, rsa, lots of content pending (_note: work in progress_) | a tiny bit of number theory would be good, e.g. know what "mod" means and know what Euler's  Theorem is (not really necessary) |
| [Vector Calculus](vectorCalculus) | Talk about div, grad, curl, then about why differential forms are better. introduce important vector calculus notions, and talk about wedge products, differential forms, exterior derivatives, stokses thm $\int_B d\phi = \int_{\partial B} \phi$, (_note: work in progress_) | should know some calculus, probably multi and linear really. Or you can just look at the colorfull vector field pictures, they're nice too :) |
| [Compression](compression) | compressiony stuff | I guess a bit of familiarity with the tree data structure is nice, but really this is a very accesible article, I hope |
