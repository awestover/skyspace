| Topic | Description | Intensity |
|---|---|---|
| [Funtional Analysis](functional_analysis) | Build up to, and proof of Projection Theorem. Might also talk about general Banach spaces but probably mostly Hilbert spaces. | Technically no prereqs, but it'll be easier to follow if you've had an introductory college course in Linear Algebra and Real Analysis ;) |
| [Cache Behavior](cacheBehavior) | An introduction to the performance benefits that cache behavior can bring to a program. | I assume you can read simple code, and that you know what a matrix is|
| [Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus/fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus.pdf) | introduce basic notions in calculus, prove fundamental theorem of calculus (incredibly rigorously with a ton of analysis)| Technically no preqeqs, but it'll be a bit cooler if you know calculus|
| [Digital Signal Processing](digitalSignalProcessing/digitalSignalProcessing.pdf) | what are signals? Fourier transform, convolutions, LTIs.| should know some linear algebra |
