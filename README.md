This repo contains some math / computer science material that I have created to teach others.

---

|Topic | Completion Status | Description|
|---|---|---|
| [Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus/fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus.pdf)  | Pretty complete | introduce basic notions in calculus, prove fundamental theorem of calculus (incredibly rigorously with a ton of analysis)|
| [Digital Signal Processing](digitalSignalProcessing/digitalSignalProcessing.pdf) | Work In Progress | what are signals? Fourier transform, convolutions, LTIs.|
| [Neat Problems](neatProblems/neatProblems.pdf) | Work in Progress | some interesting problems / riddles I've heard. Especially weird stuff, and stuff that can be done while e.g. hiking.|
| [Funtional Analysis](functional_analysis) | Work in Progress | Build up to, and proof of Projection Theorem. Might also talk about general Banach spaces but probably mostly Hilbert spaces. |
