| Topic | Description | Intensity |
|---|---|---|
| [Funtional Analysis](functional_analysis) | Build up to, and proof of Projection Theorem. Might also talk about general Banach spaces but probably mostly Hilbert spaces. | Technically no prereqs, but it'll be easier to follow if you've had an introductory college course in Linear Algebra and Real Analysis ;) |
| [Fast Integer Multiplication](fastIntegerMultiplication) | Do you feel like you're not fast enough at math? What if there were a provably faster way to do almost every computation (up to constants)? Nearly every computation that you ever do relies on multiplication (sorry if this offends anyone). In this blog post I show how to multiply together two n-digit numbers not in time O(n^2), like you've been doing your whole life till now, but in time O(n log n) using the Fast Fourier Transform. Wow!!  *terms and conditions may apply | You need to know what complex numbers are, some linear algebra is probably useful. It's not a self contained introduction to digital signal processing, you an see [Digital Signal Processing](digitalSignalProcessing/digitalSignalProcessing.pdf) for an introduction to digital signal processing. But technically you don't need to know any DSP to understand the article, because I define a fourier transform.|
| [Cache Behavior](cacheBehavior) | An introduction to the performance benefits that cache behavior can bring to a program. | I assume you can read simple code, and that you know what a matrix / 2d array is|
| [Fundamental Theorem of Calculus](fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus/fundamentalTheoremOfCalculus.pdf) | introduce basic notions in calculus, prove fundamental theorem of calculus (incredibly rigorously with a ton of analysis)| Technically no preqeqs, but it'll be a bit cooler if you know calculus|
| [Digital Signal Processing](digitalSignalProcessing/digitalSignalProcessing.pdf) | what are signals? Fourier transform, convolutions, LTIs.| should know some linear algebra |
