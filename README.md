This repo contains some math / computer science material that I have created to teach others.

---
Topic | Completion Status | Description
Fundamental Theorem of Calculus  | Pretty complete | introduce basic notions in calculus, prove fundamental theorem of calculus (incredibly rigorously with a ton of analysis)
Digital Signal Processing | Work In Progress | what are signals? Fourier transform, convolutions, LTIs.
![Neat Problems](neatProblems/neatProblems.pdf) | Work in Progress | some interesting problems / riddles I've heard. Especially weird stuff, and stuff that can be done while e.g. hiking.
functional_analysis | Work in Progress | Build up to, and proof of Projection Theorem. Might also talk about general Banach spaces but probably mostly Hilbert spaces.
