# skyspace 2

This is a blog that I hope to be able to keep consistently!
I plan to use it largely to be a way of reflecting on cool math /
cs stuff that I am learning in classes in school, in doing
random research, and in discussions with friends. 
I enjoy sharing what I learn, and find that I learn a lot by
sharing. 
Sometimes when I'm swamped with work and stumped by various
problems its easy to forget how cool and beautiful math is.
I hope that this blog can serve as a reminder that math is
awesome! Just in case you forgot.

## why skyspace 2?

skyspace 1 was great, but had some problems that prevented me
from using it super frequently. This is an attempt to remedy
those problems.

## skyspace 2 design principles:
- articles are appended to a feed
- also can be tagged into categories 

- efficiency:
  - we should not have to rebuild the entire site each time. just
  a tiny portion of it

- actively share quality content!
  - have some way for people to "subscribe"
  - advertise via word of mouth
  - also make it fun: have some reccuring characters in the blog posts

- smooth addition of new content
  - this cannot be overstated. I need to be able to bring up the
  editing window for the latest post in 5 keystrokes or less.

- logical organization: 

```
ss2/
index.html
--> links to dated articles
topics.html
--> links to the topic pages
complexity/
  index.html
  --> contains the Disquss for the category
  --> contains links to articles in the category
  --> contains the description of the category
  src/
    README.md
    --> description of the category
    images/

      title: IP

      contents: 
      story
      IP = PSPACE!

      description: 
      high probability veryify a statement without a certificate!

      body:
      blah blah blah

      begin thm
      test $\int x^2 = x^3 / 3$
      end thm

- simplicity:
--> skyspace1 was really complicated and very fragile. Hopefully
skyspace2 is better.
